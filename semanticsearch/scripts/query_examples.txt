# T-rex
Massive predator with powerful jaws and tiny arms.
A colossal theropod dinosaur, renowned for its immense size and bone-crushing bite.
Apex predator of the Late Cretaceous, possessing a fearsome reputation for its hunting prowess.
Bipedal carnivore with a large skull, serrated teeth, and disproportionately small forelimbs.
A Late Cretaceous dinosaur that dominated its ecosystem, one of the last non-avian dinosaurs.
Featuring a robust build, powerful hind limbs, a thick tail for balance, and a skull designed for extreme bite force.
Likely a both predator and scavenger, the Tyrannosaurus Rex used its keen senses and powerful build to survive.
Known from numerous fossil specimens, Tyrannosaurus Rex provides valuable insights into dinosaur anatomy and behavior.
Tyrannosaurus Rex, a large theropod dinosaur, lived during the Late Cretaceous period. It is distinguished by its massive size, powerful jaws, and small forelimbs. It was likely an apex predator and scavenger, playing a dominant role in its ecosystem. Fossil evidence has revealed much about its anatomy, behavior, and evolutionary significance.
