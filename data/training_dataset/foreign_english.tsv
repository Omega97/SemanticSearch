Welcher Vorteil hat die Konstruktion eines Filmkondensators?	Dielectric breakdowns or shorts between the electrodes do not destroy the component. The metallized construction makes it possible to produce wound capacitors with larger capacitance values (up to 100 µF and larger) in smaller cases than within film/foil construction.

The advantage of this construction is the ease of connecting the metal foil electrodes, along with an excellent current pulse strength. A key advantage of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact
