contraction of muscle definition	Types of contractions. When we think of a muscle contracting normally, we tend to think of the muscle shortening as it generates force. While it's true that this is a way of muscle contracting, there are many different ways that a muscle can generate force, as seen in Figure 1 below. Concentric ContractionsMuscle Actively Shortening. When a muscle is activated and required to lift a load which is less than the maximum tetanic tension it can generate, the muscle begins to shorten. Contractions that permit the muscle to shorten are referred to as concentric contractions. An example of a concentric contraction in the raising of a weight during a bicep curl. In concentric contractions, the force generated by the muscle is always less than the muscle's maximum (P o). As the load the muscle is required to lift decreases, contraction velocity increases. This occurs until the muscle finally reaches its maximum contraction velocity, V max. By performing a series of constant velocity shortening contractions, a force-velocity relationship can be determinedMuscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state. Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: length and tension. A muscle contraction is described as isometric if the muscle tension changes but the muscle length remains the same. In contrast, a muscle contraction is isotonic if muscle length changes but the muscle tension remains the same. Furthermore, if the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric
what diseases cause severely bloodshot eyes	On this page: Causes of red eyes • Red eye treatment • Tips for preventing red eyes. See also: Broken blood vessel in the eye • All about eye allergies • Answers to reader questions about dry eyes • Relief for dry, irritated eyes. We've all experienced red, bloodshot eyes from time to time, affecting one or both eyes. Red eye is caused by swollen or dilated blood vessels on the sclera, the white outer surface of the eye. Red eyes can be accompanied by eye pain, itching, eye discharge, swollen eyes or visual disturbances such as blurry vision. In other cases, a red eye may cause no irritation at all. Common Causes of Red Eye. Conjunctivitis. Also called  pink eye , conjunctivitis is one of the most common (and contagious) eye infections, particularly among school children. It occurs when the conjunctiva  the thin, normally transparent membrane that covers the sclera and lines the eyelids  becomes infected.Bloodshot eyes describe a condition in which the whites of the eyes appear red. Bloodshot eyes occur when the blood vessels in the sclera (the white of the eye) dilate or swell. A variety of mild to serious diseases, disorders and conditions can irritate the blood vessels of the sclera and cause bloodshot eyes. Bloodshot eyes are often due to mild conditions, such as eye fatigue, dehydration, and overuse of contact lenses. They can also be due to infections and allergic reactions. In some cases, a bloodshot or red eye or eyes can indicate an emergent condition that can lead to loss of sight, such as acute glaucoma or an eye injury. Bloodshot eyes can begin suddenly and disappear quickly, such as when you have a mild allergic reaction to animal dander or dust. Bloodshot eyes can also develop with time and occur along with additional symptoms, which may be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a corneal ulcer or eye infection.
acidic food definition	Foods that produce an alkaline ash are called alkaline forming food whereas those producing acid ash are called acid-forming foods. The body needs both types of foods. However alkaline forming food should predominate over acid forming ones. pH (potential of hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. The pH is measured on a scale of 0 to 14--the lower the pH the more acidic the solution, the higher the pH the more alkaline (or base) the solution. When a body is healthy, the pH of blood is 7.4, the pH of urine is 7.4, and the pH of saliva is 7.4. The pH of saliva or urine parallels the extra cellular fluid. Certain areas of the body should be more acidic than others-such as the stomach. Other areas should be more on the alkaline side. When testing the urine or saliva with pH paper sticks, aim for a level of 7.4. The foods we eat are digested and they break down into either an acid or an alkaline end-product in our tissuA pH of 14, meanwhile, is the most base, or alkaline. A pH of 7 is neutral territory. Different parts of the human body have different pH levels. Our ideal blood pH is held tightly and slightly alkaline between 7.35 and 7.45. In contrast, our stomach is typically 3.5, acid-strong so that food can break down properly. A diet that consists of too many acid-producing foods, such as protein, can cause acidity in your urine, which can cause a type of kidney stone called uric acid stones to form. It’s been speculated that overacidity can cause bone and muscle deterioration. Some foods and substances that you should try to limit, rather than completely avoid, include the following: 1  nuts (cashew, peanut, walnuts). 2  seeds (pumpkin, sunflower). 3  most legumes. 4  fruits (blueberry, cranberry, plum). 5  corn oil. 6  sweeteners (sugars, molasses, maple syrup, processed honey, aspartame). 7  salt.
how much does a funeral or cremation cost in the philippines	An engraved memorial plaque costs as little as $100; a memorial statue or a memorial bench is in the $2,000 to $3,000 range. Caskets are unquestionably more expensive than cremation urns. Many caskets are priced in the $1,000 to $2,000 range, with a select few options for a budget between $500 and $1,000. More elaborate caskets that include precious woods and materials can easily skyrocket to $14,000. Headstones tend to cost more than cremation memorials. Prices vary, depending on the region and material, but the least expensive headstones are typically priced in the $200 to $500 range. More elaborate upright markers range from $1,000 to $3,000, with prices quickly escalating for fine materials or elaborate details. Cremation urns vary dramatically in cost based on an array of factors. The size of the urn, the materials used in its construction, and the simplicity of its design all play a role in cost. Families can buy a simple scattering urn made of biodegradable materials for as little as $50 to $100.Funeral Cost. Funeral homes, cemeteries and other service providers in Philippines expect to receive payment in full at the time of the funeral. With the average cost of a funeral around $8,000 in the United States for example, it can be a hardship if you have not planned ahead for this expenditure. Average Philippines Funeral Costs. . advertisement. According to last year’s funeral price survey, the average Philippines funeral costs for an adult funeral is $7,775. This is based on the most commonly selected items for a traditional funeral including a casket and vault. However, it does not include cemetery costs in Philippines. A grave space, a grave marker, and opening/closing the grave can easily cost another $1,500 to $2,500 in Philippines. Therefore, a typical traditional funeral and burial cost is likely at least $9,000
what enzyme is responsible for breaking the hydrogen bonds the hold together the base pairs during replication? (also called unzipping the dna strand	The DNA double helix is held together by two types of bonds, covalent and hydrogen. Covalent bonds occur within each linear strand and strongly bond the bases, sugars, and phosphate groups (both within each component and between components). Hydrogen bonds occur between the two strands and involve a base from one strand with a base from the second in complementary pairing. These hydrogen bonds are individually weak but collectively quite strong. 3. A primer is a short segment of RNA that is synthesized by primase using DNA as a template during DNA replication. Once the primer is synthesized, DNA polymerase then adds DNA to the 3´ end of the RNA.The DNA double helix is held together by two types of bonds, covalent and. hydrogen.

Once the primer is synthesized, DNA polymerase then adds DNA to the 3´ end of the RNA. Primers are required because the major DNA polymerase involved with DNA replication is unable to initiate DNA synthesis and, rather, requires a 3´ end. (It is the 3´ -OH group that is required to create the next phosphodiester bond.) The RNA is subsequently removed and replaced with DNA so that no gaps exist in the final product. 4. Helicases are enzymes that disrupt the hydrogen bonds that hold the two DNA strands together in a double helix. This breakage is required for both RNA and DNA synthesis.
what does pcv stand for	This way, the PCV valve is very important for different aspects and helps car owners maintaining their car’s engines in shape as well as providing them with a good administration of the fuel economy. The PCV valve routes crankcase partially burned gases back to the engine. Once these gases go back to the engine, they are re-burned, allowing this way a better use and administration of fuel. Due to its tasks, the PCV valve is not only very useful but also implies important benefits. It completely eliminates crankcase emissions efficiently, avoiding that it becomes an air pollution factor. Besides, it also keeps the system free of moisture due to the constant air circulation that it implies.Thus the PCV valve extends the life of the oil and engine. The PCV valve requires little maintenance. The valve and filter should be replaced somewhere around 30,000 to 50,000 miles(see the vehicle owners manual for service intervals). PCV is an acronym for Positive Crankcase Ventilation. This valve is needed to relieve the pressure built up in the crankcase that is created by the heating of the air inside the engine. If this valve were not present and the pressure went unchecked, it would blow out the seals and gaskets inside your engine. PCV stands for Positive Crankcase Ventilation. This replaceable valve replaced the vent pipe on the engine, this got rid of the fumes and or pressure that builds up in the crankcase, nowadays the crankcase does not vent into the environment. The PCV valve is located on the right side of the engine, between the base of the oil filter and the base of the PCV valve which is located near the front of the e … ngine just below the thermostat housing. Locate the oil filter then look toward the front of the engine.
infections caused by bacteria	Bacterial Skin Infections. Bacterial skin infections are usually caused by gram-positive strains of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus or other organisms. Common bacterial skin infections include: 1  Cellulitis causes a painful, red infection that is usually warm to the touch. 2  Folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles that causes red, swollen bumps that look like pimples. 3  Impetigo causes oozing sores, usually in preschool-aged children. 4  Boils are deep skin infections that start in hair ... Sometimes, these infections aren't associated with any symptoms but can still cause serious damage to the reproductive system. Common STDs caused by bacterial infections include: 1  Chlamydia is an infection in men and women caused by an organism called Chlamydia trachomatis.Harmful bacteria that cause bacterial infections and disease are called pathogenic bacteria. Bacterial diseases occur when pathogenic bacteria get into the body and begin to reproduce and crowd out healthy bacteria, or to grow in tissues that are normally sterile. Harmful bacteria may also emit toxins that damage the body. Common pathogenic bacteria and the types of bacterial diseases they cause include: Escherichia coli and Salmonella cause food poisoning. Helicobacter pylori cause gastritis and ulcers. Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea. Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis. Staphylococcus aureus causes a variety of infections in the body, including boils, cellulitis, abscesses, wound infections, toxic shock syndrome, pneumonia, and food poisoning. Streptococcal bacteria cause a variety of infections in the body, including pneumonia, meningitis, ear infections, and strep throat
what is the difference between asteroids and meteorites	Asteroid: a large rocky body in space, in orbit around the Sun. Meteoroid: much smaller rocks or particles in orbit around the Sun. Meteor: If a meteoroid enters the Earth’s atmosphere and vaporizes, it becomes a meteor, which is often called a shooting star. Meteorite: If a small asteroid or large meteoroid survives its fiery passage through the Earth’s atmosphere and lands on Earth’s surface, it is then called a meteorite. Another related term is bolide, which is a very bright meteor that often explodes in the atmosphere. This can also be called a fireball. Summary. In short, the difference between asteroids and meteors all comes down to a question of location. Asteroids are always found in space. Once it enters an atmosphere, it becomes a meteor, and then a meteorite after it hits the ground.Meteoroid-A small particle from an asteroid or comet orbiting the Sun. Meteor-A meteoroid that is observed as it burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere – a shooting star. Meteorite-A meteoroid that survives its passage through the Earth’s atmosphere and impacts the Earth’s surface. In summation, an asteroid is a relatively small object out in space. When an asteroid breaks through our atmosphere and burns up, it becomes a meteor. If the asteroid manages to get all the way through our atmosphere and actually hits the surface of the planet, it is classified as a meteorite. Meteor-A meteoroid that is observed as it burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere – a shooting star. Meteorite-A meteoroid that survives its passage through the Earth’s atmosphere and impacts the Earth’s surface. “ 1 Meteorite Strikes In Russia’s Ural Mountains”. “ 2 Asteroid To Make Close Call With Earth”.
what is a novelist	Top 10 amazing movie makeup transformations. A novelist is a creative writer who specializes in long form fiction writing, as opposed to the shorter forms such as poetry, essays or short stories. A novelist creates fictional characters, then places them within the context of an imaginary setting. An aspiring novelist may choose to earn a degree in creative writing or journalism. A novelist often needs to develop a concept strong enough to be sustained over the length of a novel. Ernest Hemingway was a great American novelist.A novelist is a type of writer, or author, who creates long works of fiction. The majority of novelists typically prefer to write books in one genre, but some have written books in several different genres. Many novelists have written books with elements of two or more different genres. If you’ve ever gotten pulled into a good book that you couldn’t put down, you have most likely fallen victim to a novel. Novels are by far the most popular type of fiction on the market today. On average, a novel is basically a story that is usually over 40,000 words. Shorter books are often referred to as novellas or novelettes, depending on how long they are. As with many other works of fiction, a basic novel has a few necessary components. First of all, it has to have a plot. In most instances, authors will typically need to make this plot believable, or at least possible. Second, a novel will also need to have a setting, meaning a time and place that the story is taking place. Some novels may even have several settings. Finally, a novel must have characters. In order to keep readers interested in the story, these characters must be believable

difference between chromatin and chromosome	On the other hand, chromatin is a mass of genetic material containing DNA, RNA, and various proteins that forms chromosomes. **before mitosis, the DNA is loose in the nucleus in the form of chromatin. When the DNA begins to undergo mitosis the chromatin condenses to form the chromosome. The difference between chromatin and chromosomes is that chromosomes help to make up chromatin. Chromatin is made up of DNA and proteins, and is what makes the nucleus of a cell. Chromosomes make up the DNA. Chromosome … s are condensed chromatin and chromatin is unfolded chromosomes. The only difference I know is that chromatin are present normally in a cell, while chromosomes are there only when the cell is about to divide. When the cell is about to divide, the chromatin threads get organised into chromosomes.Chromatin and chromosomes are basically the same thing. The difference is that chromatin is unfolded, uncondensed, extended DNA while chromosomes are condensed DNA. Chromosomes are condensed chromatin and chromatin is unfolded chromosomes.

what temperature is a fever dangerous for a child	Fevers help the body fight infection. Fever is a symptom, not a disease. In most cases, fever means your child has a minor illness. Often you must look at your child's other symptoms to determine how serious the illness is. Although it may be scary when your child's temperature goes up, fever is not harmful. The average normal body temperature is about 98.6°F (37°C) . It usually rises during the day from a low of 97.4°F (36.3°C) in the morning to a high of 99.6°F (37.6°C) in the late afternoon. If you think your child has a fever but you are not able to measure his or her temperature, it is important to look for other symptoms of illness. Children tend to run higher fevers than adults. The degree of fever may not indicate how serious your child's illness is. With a minor illness, such as a cold, a child may have a temperature of 104°F (40°C) , while a very serious infection may not cause a fever or may cause only a mild feverA fever is not a reliable indication of your child's state of health, the Nemours Foundation notes. In some cases, viral infections such as colds can raise your child's temperature to high levels without actually causing any great amount of risk. If you take an oral reading, your child's normal temperature should be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians, or AAFP. If you take a rectal reading, your child's normal temperature should be 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit. For oral readings, doctors commonly define a fever as any temperature in excess of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. For rectal readings, doctors commonly define a fever as any temperature in excess of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit
why is an mri so noisy	MRIs also notice the strength of these radio signals. Where there is a lot of water, for example in muscle, the signal is strong, and where there is less water, for example in bone, the signal is weak. The different strengths of the radio waves enable the MRI to fill in the image with the proper shades of gray. An MRI is noisy because its magnetic field is created by running electrical current through a coiled wire—an electromagnet. When the current is switched on, there is an outward force all along the coil. And because the magnetic field is so strong, the force on the coil is very large. The frequency of the proton's radio wave is determined by its wobbling rate; so the protons in water emit a radio frequency of about 50 million cycles per second. The heart of an MRI is basically just a strong magnet and a radio transmitter and receiver, plus a lot of electronics to coordinate their operation.Magnetic resonance imaging produces images of the body by causing shifts in a very strong magnetic field and measuring how tissues react, Dr. Hentel said. The principal magnet of an M.R.I. scanner commonly is strong enough to produce fields 60,000 times the strength of the earth’s natural magnetic field. Inside the scanner are coils of metal wire called gradient coils. When electricity is passed through such a coil, a magnetic field is created. The pulses cause not just the desired changes but undesired vibrations of the gradient coils, resulting in the banging heard during an M.R.I. examination. As stronger magnets result in stronger vibrations, the higher the field strength of the M.R.I. scanner, measured in teslas, the louder the banging
where did greek yogurt originate	Yogurt, yoghurt, or yoghourt (/ˈjoʊɡərt/ or /ˈjɒɡət/ ; from Turkish: yoğurt; other spellings listed below) is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tang. Worldwide, cow 's milk, the protein of which is mainly casein, is most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks, however, is also used to produce yogurt in various parts of the world. Da-hi is a yogurt of the Indian subcontinent, known for its characteristic taste and consistency. The word da-hi seems to be derived from the Sanskrit word dadhi, one of the five elixirs, or panchamrita, often used in Hindu ritual.She said Greek yogurt was the subject of frequent questions. It's a style of yogurt, something like choosing to have drinkable yogurt instead of solid. It appears to have originated in the Middle East, and traditionally was called Greek yogurt, she said. It's a newer product to the United States, but is not called that because it's shipped in from Greece.. Frese said Greek yogurt is processed in a different way than the yogurts American consumers are more used to, and there is no one standard way to make and manufacture this type of yogurt. She said Greek yogurt is a more sticky product, with a tangy and sometimes tart taste. Typically, for making Greek-style yogurt, the milk is concentrated and the water evaporates. Next, the liquid whey would be separated or strained off, resulting in a thicker product, Fres

during the lytic cycle the assembly of new viral particles	Viruses that only use lytic cycle are called virulent viruses (in contrast to temperate viruses). The lytic cycle is a six-stage cycle. In the first stage, called penetration, the virus injects its own nucleic acid into a host cell. In some viruses this genetic material is circular and mimics a bacterial plasmid. Lytic cycle, compared to lysogenic cycle. The lytic cycle is one of the two cycles of viral reproduction, the other being the lysogenic cycle. The lytic cycle results in the destruction of the infected cell and its membrane. A key difference between the lytic and lysogenic phage cycles is that in the lytic phage, the viral DNA exists as a separate molecule within the bacterial cell, and replicates separately from the host bacterial DNABriefly describe the difference between the lytic cycle of virulent phages and the lysogenic cycle of temperate phages. Virulent phages reproduce strictly by the lytic cycle and ultimately result in the death of the host bacterial cell. During the lytic cycle, a virus injects its genome into the host cell. The genome directs production and assembly of new viral particles. A viral enzyme is produced and breaks open the cell, releasing new viral particles into the environment. Temperature phages can utilize either the lytic or lysogenic cycle. The infection cycle begins when a viral particle injects its genome into the host cell. In the lysogenic cycle, the viral genome integrates into the host chromosome as a prophage. The inactive prophage can remain part of the bacterial chromosome for an extended period and is replicated along with the bacterial chromosome prior to cell division.
when can a widow draw social security	What's your full benefits age? It's the same as your full retirement age for claiming your own Social Security retirement benefits – between 65 and 66, depending on the year you were born. Once you reach full retirement age, there is no limit on the income you can earn and still collect your full survivors benefits. If you are less than full retirement age, though, Social Security deducts $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above $13,560. That's the limit for 2008 – it goes up each year. There's a special rule if you reach full retirement age this year. In that case, Social Security deducts $1 from your survivors benefits for each $3 you earn above $36,120 up to the month you reach full retirement age.You probably know people who are receiving Social Security survivors benefits because they're a widow or widower. At present, there are about 5 million widows and widowers receiving monthly Social Security benefits based on their deceased spouse's earnings record. And, for many of those survivors, particularly aged women, those benefits are keeping them out of poverty. Your widow or widower can receive: reduced benefits as early as age 60 or full benefits at full retirement age or older. benefits as early as age 50 if he or she is disabled AND their disability started before or within seven years of your death. Note: If a widow or widower who is caring for your children receives Social Security benefits, he or she is still eligible if their disability starts before those payments end or within seven years after they end. Widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses cannot apply online for survivors benefits.
what does transversus abdominis workouts do	However it is critical for strengthening the core and minimizing back injury. There are not too many ab exercises for this deep muscle, however you don't need a wide variety to help tone and strengthen the transverse abdominis. The transversus abdominis is the deepest of the abdominal muscles. By strengthening this muscle, you are helping prevent lower back pain and injuries. This is because this muscle helps stabilize your spine and pelvis. It is a key component to your core muscles. Core muscles are those that stabilize the spine and pelvis during exercise/activity. A couple of the videos above have a series of exercises to strengthen the transverse abdominal muscle. To go the the Plank Pose, use the link above or the next button below. These transverse abdominal exercises focus primarily on the transverse abdominis muscle although other muscles will be engaged during some of the workouts.The transversus abdominis is the deepest abdominal muscle. It sits below the oblique muscles. It acts as an abdominal support belt and plays a major role in maintaining posture. Most abdominal exercises involve the transversus abdominis; however, the transverse abdominal exercises below focus on it in particular. These exercises are excellent for improving core stability and strength and preventing lower back pain. The stability ball bridge is a stabilizing exercise that works the transversus abdominis muscles. This is a good exercise for users of varying experience because the user can vary the amount of time the bridge is performed for. More experienced users may hold the bridge for a longer period than less experienced users.
how much should church pay for utilities	Thus if a church has a budget of $50,000 then the pay for the Pastor should be $23,000 to $32,000 a year. If the budget is $100,000 then the pay should be $45,000 to $55,000 a year. Again with all things equal, a church of 100 people should give at least $2000 a week. (That's $20 a person which is 8% of minimum wage-which is below the recommended 10% tithe) This would bring a total of $104,000 a year. A church of 100 people should easily be able to pay at least $45,000 for a Pastor. So if the giving is low, his pay should be low. For example: A church of 100 people and each person on the average only gives $5 then they would bring in $500 dollars a week. Thus the Pastors pay will be lower than if the church members gave $10 or $20 or $50 per person. 6.Example – #1 – this pastor receives a cash salary of $45,000 per year and lives in a church owned parsonage with a monthly Fair Market Rental Value (FMRV) of $1600; the annual FMRV is $19,200. The church pays the utilities (which they should) that amount to $2,800 per year. His annual self-employment tax (Social Security) will amount to $9,467 ($45,000 + 19,200 + 2,800 = $67,000 x 92.35% = $61,875 x 15.3% = $9,467) of which the church agrees to pay $6,500 (9.8% of $67,000). 5. Life Insurance – $100,000 of term life insurance, paid by the church, with the wife as beneficiary – this protects the church and provides for the family upon a premature death. The church can pay the premiums on the policy but only the premium on the first $50,000 is a tax-free fringe benefit. The pastor should provide his own additional life insurance as needed, probably in the $500,000 range
what does ibu stand for in beer making	Check out the strongest naturally-fermented beer in the world here. Like ABV, IBU (International Bitterness Units) is another common measurement for beer. Rather than telling us how much alcohol there is, IBU measures the bitterness from hops in a beer on a scale of 0 to 100. In more technical terms, IBU gauges the isomerized alpha acids from hops in a beer in parts per million. Very hoppy beers, like imperial IPAs, can reach 80 BU. It can take years of effort and lots of batches of beer to create a delicious brew. The more you understand about the beer you’re drinking, the more you can fully appreciate it in all of its glory. Two important measurements of beer that you should know are ABV and IBU. Figuring out what they mean and how they relate to beer can help you to better understand your own preference for beer and the beers behind the bar. Even better, you’ll never get lost in a conversation about brews againIBU stands for International Bitterness Units and is a standardised measure of the bitterness of beer set by the European Brewing Convention (EBC). The bitterness of beer comes from alpha acids found in hops; the concentration of alpha acids is directly proportional to the theoretical bitterness of the beer. This concentration can be measure in a laboratory and hence a figure assigned to the bitterness of the beer. Well, there is actually no such thing as 80 proof beer. Proof, in short, is a measure of the alcoholic content beverages, used specifically in hard spirits. The proof, specifi … cally, is double the content of alcohol by volume. For example, most vodka is 80 proof, which means it contains 40%
can a cna participate in triage for an infant in florida	Board certification can be obtained following clinical experience as a staff nurse and working in the labor and delivery unit. Job Outlook. While the job outlook for nurses in many areas of practice is positive, it is estimated that positions as a labor and delivery nurse may be harder to obtain over the next decade. Salary. The average yearly salary for a nurse specializing in labor and delivery is approximately $55,000 a year. A labor and delivery nurse who has several years of experience can expect to make closer to $70,000 or more. Those nurses with a master’s degree or higher can also make a significantly higher annual salary. The annual pay level for a labor and delivery nurse is often higher in metropolitan areas verses rural areasA Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) provides a basic nursing service under the supervision of a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), or a Registered Nurse (RN). Certified Nurse Assistants can work in any healthcare setting such as a Hospital, Nursing home, Community Center, Hospice, School, Outpatient facility and so on. The shift of a CNA is usually 7.5 hours with a 1 hour break. This break can be split between a 30 minute lunch break and two 15 minute breaks. To earn additional income, many Certified Nurse Assistants work double shifts. Some CNAs work a second job elsewhere, and can work 6 or even 7 days per week. A temporary job as a CNA can be used by many prospective nurses or healthcare professionals to test the water before committing to a lengthy degree/doctoral program. The daily duties of a CNA depend on his/her work setting, and include the following: 1  Observing residents.

does a fistula infuse an artery and vein	Brain Dural Arteriovenous Fistula (BDAVF). The word “fistula” means abnormal connection between two structures that are normally not connected. An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. Any part of the body can have a fistula.The brain is surrounded by a tough fibrous cover called “dura mater” or “dura”. When a fistula forms between an artery and a vein within the dura, it is called Brain Dural Fistula, or Brain Dural Arteriovenous Fistula, or BDAVF, etc.ny part of the body can have a fistula. The brain is surrounded by a tough fibrous cover called “dura mater” or “dura”. When a fistula forms between an artery and a vein within the dura, it is called Brain Dural Fistula, or Brain Dural Arteriovenous Fistula, or BDAVF, etc.Normally, blood flows from arteries into capillaries and then into veins. When an arteriovenous fistula is present, blood flows directly from an artery into a vein, bypassing the capillaries.A person may be born with an arteriovenous fistula (congenital fistula), or a fistula may develop after birth (acquired fistula).Congenital arteriovenous fistulas are uncommon.Acquired arteriovenous fistulas can be caused by any injury that damages an artery and a vein that lie side by side.

was a cave formed by erosion or deposition	Erosional caves can be found in almost any kind of rock, from hard granite to soft claystones, and even including limestone. In fact erosion can be a very active process in caves originally formed by solution caves as well, but usually occurs after the cave has drained and surface streams are pirated into the cave. Erosion tends to produce tall, canyon-like passages. Running water on glaciers may sink into crevasses and melt a path through the glacier to form glacier caves. These often show pronounced scalloping on the walls and ceilings, and are often decorated with ice formations. Sandstone is soft and readily eroded. In some areas wind has sculpted large (but not deep or extensive) caves, as the one on the left. Note the large sand dune below the left-hand entrance. On the right is a smaller cave with extensive wind sculpting from Castle Rock State Park in California.While most of the landmass of Earth is made of igneous and  metamorphic rocks, most of the rocks that we can actually see (i.e.  those on the surface) are sedime … ntary. Sedimentary rocks are formed  from deposition by forces like rivers, waves and glaciers.  Sediment, however, comes from eroded material. The same forces that  deposit material also erode material. Most sand in deserts and on  beaches is made by silicon oxide, otherwise known as quartz. A mountain is a sharpened peak formed by the glacial actions of three cirques on a mountaintop. Since we know that a cirque is a bowl-shaped basin formed by EROSION and a moun … tain horn is formed by three CIRQUES it becomes clear that mountain horns are formed by erosion.
does yellow mucus mean infection	Sinusitis arises from the inflammation of the sinuses with a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. Many people think that a yellow or green nasal discharge means a bacterial infection, which requires antibiotics but it is not true.It can be a sign that your body is being attacked by either a bacteria or a virus. That said, a yellow discharge does not necessarily indicate a sinus infection.owever, a yellow discharge can also be a symptom of nasal polyps or an allergic reaction to the environment: pollens, smog, house dust, smoke, or chemical fumes, etc. It is, therefore, a must to address an allergic attack right away.You might have heard that yellow or green mucus is a clear sign that you have an infection, but despite that common misperception, the yellow or green hue isn't due to bacteria. When you have a cold, your immune system sends white blood cells called neutrophils rushing to the area.These cells contain a greenish-colored enzyme, and in large numbers they can turn the mucus the same color. But you can have perfectly clear mucus and have a terrible ear and sinus infection , Kao says.If you do have an infection, you'll likely also have other symptoms, such as congestion, fever, and pressure in your face, overlying the sinuses, Johns says.1 | 2 | 3 | 4.

what vitamins are in apple cider vinegar	In addition to the acetic and malic acid, apple cider vinegar also possesses a number of characteristic acids, vitamins, mineral salts and amino acids. These nutrients work together to make cider vinegar the effective health tonic it is today. Among the tonic’s active ingredients are soluble fiber in the form of pectin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, beta-carotene and lycopene. Apple cider vinegar can be used effectively internally and externally. The vinegar is often used as an astringent or toner for treating a number of skin conditions. Other common ailments apple cider vinegar can treat include acne, sunburn, shingles, insect bites, dandruff, allergic reactions and vaginal infections. A fermented juice made from crushed apples, apple cider vinegar contains high concentrations of acetic acid, B vitamins, vitamin C and a host of other nutrients. All of these nutrients together function in the body to treat sickness and alleviate illnessApple cider vinegar is fermented juice from crushed apples. Like apple juice, it probably contains some pectin; vitamins B1, B2, and B6; biotin; folic acid; niacin; pantothenic acid; and vitamin C. It also contains small amounts of the minerals sodium, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. It can be hard to know what’s in some apple cider vinegar products. Laboratory analysis of commercially available apple cider vinegar tablets shows wide variation in what they contain. Amounts of acetic acid ranged from about 1% to 10.57%. Amounts of citric acid ranged from 0% to about 18.5%.
why do you need 6 months validity on passport	Do I need six months validity left on my passport before I can travel from and then re enter Australia? You passport is valid from the date it is issued until the date it expires. You can use it throughout this period, subject to meeting the visa and immigration requirements of the countries you wish to visit or transit. Some foreign governments require visitors to carry passports with at least six months validity beyond their planned stay. You may be refused entry if you do not comply. Well before you travel, you should check the entry requirements of the countries you plan to visit or transit.Some countries require that your passport be valid at least six months beyond the dates of your trip. Some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met. Consider the following scenario: A country requires that you have at least six months of validity on your passport. You currently have seven months of validity on your passport. However, your trip is two months from now. At that point, you will only have five months of validity remaining on your passport which is not enough to satisfy that country's entry requirements. In this situation, you would need to renew your passport before you can make your trip. Check our Country Specific Information to learn about entry and exit requirements for the country or countries in which you are traveling. Watch this short YouTube video about why you need at least six months of validity on your U.S. passport! If your passport has already expired, you may still be able to renew your passport by mail.

what foods are major source of protein and fat	Carefully planned nutrition must provide an energy balance and a nutrient balance. The nutrients are: 1  Proteins-essential to growth and repair of muscle and other body tissues. 2  Fats-one source of energy and important in relation to fat soluble vitamins. 3  Carbohydrates-our main source of energy. 4  Minerals-those inorganic elements occurring in the body and which are critical to its normal functions. All meals should contain both carbohydrate and protein - 20 to 30 grams worth of protein with each main meal and 10 to 20 grams with each snack. The amount of carbohydrate will vary greatly, mainly depending on your workload. It may be in the region of 40 to 60 grams for main meals and 20 to 30 grams for snacks.Proteins provide the 20 amino acids which make up the cells, tissues and organs of your body. Your body makes over half the amino acids needed, but your diet must provide the rest -- the essential amino acids. Some foods are “complete” sources of protein and contain all the essential amino acids. Animal-based foods are the main sources of complete protein and include meat, fish, poultry, eggs, milk and cheese. Plant-based foods also contain protein, but are “incomplete” sources of protein, meaning they contain only some of the essential amino acids. Most of your fat requirement should come from unsaturated sources. The main sources of “healthy” fats include nuts and seeds, fish, avocados and most plant-based oils, such as olive oil or canola oil. Healthy fats can help reduce your LDLs or “bad cholesterol.. Saturated fats, on the other hand, increase your bad cholesterol
best cable to connect pc to router	An Ethernet cable is the most common type of network cable used on a wired network whether at home or in any other business establishment. This cable connects wired devices together to the local network for file sharing and Internet access.

where do urethral structures occur	An anterior urethral stricture is a scar of the urethral epithelium (the urethra’s outside layer of cells) and commonly extends into the underlying corpus spongiosum (a column of erectile tissue that surrounds the urethra).he scar (stricture) is composed of dense collagen and fibroblasts (proteins that form cell-producing connective tissue) and thus contracts in all directions, shortening urethral length and narrowing the diameter of the urethra. Strictures usually do not cause symptoms until the urethra tube is below a certain size.0. 8. A urethral stricture is a narrowing of a section of your urethra. It causes a blocked or reduced flow of urine which can lead to complications. There are various treatment options which aim to widen the narrowed section of your urethra. The urethra is the tube that urine flows out of from your bladder.It passes through your penis in men. The urethra is much shorter in women and ends just above your vagina. (In men, semen is also ejaculated through the urethra.). A stricture occurs when a part of your urethra becomes narrowed.Any section of your urethra may be affected. There is usually some scar tissue around the affected part of your urethra that causes the narrowing.The length of strictures vary from less than 1 cm to the full length of the urethra. stricture occurs when a part of your urethra becomes narrowed.

genetic variation is based on what	Genetic variation is a fact that a biological system – individual and population – is different over space. It is the base of the genetic variability of different biological systems in space. Genetic variation is based on the variation in alleles of genes in a gene pool. It occurs both within and among populations, supported by individual carriers of the variant genes. Genetic variation is brought about by random mutation, which is a permanent change in the chemical structure of a gene. Mutations are likely to be rare and most mutations are neutral or deleterious, but in some instances the new alleles can be favored by natural selection. Polyploidy is an example of chromosomal mutation. Polyploidy is a condition wherein organisms have three or more sets of genetic variation (3n or more).Whereas inbreeding can lead to a reduction in genetic variation, outbreeding can lead to an increase. Sometimes, there can be random fluctuations in the numbers of alleles in a population. These changes in relative allele frequency, called genetic drift, can either increase or decrease by chance over time. A population bottleneck arises when a significant number of individuals in a population die or are otherwise prevented from breeding, resulting in a drastic decrease in the size of the population. Genetic drift can result in the loss of rare alleles, and can decrease the size of the gene pool. Genetic drift can also cause a new population to be genetically distinct from its original population, which has led to the hypothesis that genetic drift plays a role in the evolution of new species
how much fuel do you need to get to mars and back	Spike in Israeli-Palestinian violence. India launched its first spacecraft to Mars Tuesday at a price tag of $72 million. It takes less fuel to propel India's Mars orbiter 485 million miles to the Red Planet than you think. India launched its first spacecraft to Mars Tuesday on a trip that will last over 300 days at a cost of $72 million. The 3,000-pound orbiter named Mangalyaan – or Mars orbiter in Hindi – faces the unenviable task of traveling 485 million miles through space to visit the dusty, lonesome Red Planet. It will take a lot of fuel, but perhaps not as much as you might think. In nearly half a century of flights to Mars, engineers have developed techniques for cutting down on fuel and harnessing the natural celestial movements of Earth and its neighbors to propel crafts through spaceIn India's Mars mission, it took a launch vehicle called PSLV-C25, measuring 145 feet long and carrying over 200 tons of propellant fuel.

the physics of lightning	Lightning is caused by the build up of electrostatic charge in clouds. One region within the cloud builds up a positive charge and the other a negative charge. The process is not completely understood as to why, but the bottom of the cloud usually ends up being negatively charged and the top positively charged. If the build up (separation) of charge becomes great enough, the negative charges may leap to the positive side of another cloud, this is called sheet lightning or it may leap to the ground. The animation shows he creation of a ground strike of lightning. As the negative charges collect at the bottom of the cloud it forces the negative charges in the ground to be forced away from the surface. This leaves the ground positive. A streamer of negative charges is repelled by the bottom of the cloud and attracted by the ground. As this streamer of negative charges approaches the ground, a streamer of positive charges is repelled by the ground and attracted to the negative streamerLightning is the result of the build up of electrostatic charge in clouds. Positive and negative charges separate, negative usually towards the bottom of the cloud, while positive goes to the top. After a certain amount of time, the negative charge leaps, connecting with either another cloud or even the ground. When these negative and positive charges connect, a return stroke occurs. The result is a bright, flickering flash of light, which is usually followed by a rumble of thunder. Lightning is a form of electricity. Benjamin Franklin discovered this in his well-known key and kite experiment.
occurs as snow is converted to directly into water vapor	Sublimation is the conversion between the solid and the gaseous phases of matter, with no intermediate liquid stage. For those of us interested in the water cycle, sublimation is most often used to describe the process of snow and ice changing into water vapor in the air without first melting into water. The opposite of sublimation is deposition, where water vapor changes directly into ice—such a snowflakes and frost. It is not easy to actually see sublimation occuring, at least not with ice. One way to see the results of sublimation is to hang a wet shirt outside on a below-freezing day. In summary, energy is needed for the sublimation of ice to vapor to occur, and most of the energy is needed in the vaporization phase. A cubic centimeter (1 gram) of water in ice form requires 80 calories to melt, 100 calories to rise to boiling point, and another 540 calories to vaporize, a total of 720 calories.Water vapor, or water vapour or aqueous vapor, is the gaseous phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Unlike other forms of water, water vapor is invisible. Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition is often referred to as complete saturation.
definition of ribosomal subunits	rRNA: Ribosomal RNA, a molecular component of a ribosome, the cell's essential protein factory. Strictly speaking, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) does not make proteins. It makes polypeptides (assemblies of amino acids) that go to make up proteins. A tiny particulate structure located in the cytoplasm of the cell (outside the nucleus), the ribosome is composed of two subunits, one larger than the other. Although the ribosome consists of both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein, the active site on the large unit of the ribosome -- the site of the chemical reaction that changes genetic information into the beginnings of a protein -- contains only rRNA.The ribosome (/ˈraɪbɵˌzoʊm/) is a large and complex molecular machine, found within all living cells, that serves as the site of biological protein synthesis (translation). Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small ribosomal subunit, which reads the RNA, and the large subunit, which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of proteins. The sequence of DNA encoding for a protein may be copied many times into RNA chains of a similar sequence. Ribosomes can bind to an RNA chain and use it as a template for determining the correct sequence of amino acids in a particular protein. Amino acids are selected, collected and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA molecules), which enter one part of the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain

what is a phrase marker in linguistics	PRO (linguistics). From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In generative linguistics, PRO (called big PRO, distinct from pro, small pro or  little pro ) is a pronominal determiner phrase (DP) without phonological content. As such, it is part of the set of empty categories. The null pronoun PRO is postulated in the subject position of non-finite clauses. For a sentence such as (14a), there is a debate about whether PRO moves from Spec-VP (where it is introduced) to Spec-TP in non-finite clauses. Baltin (1995) argues that the tense marker to does not have an EPP feature, and that therefore PRO does not move to Spec-TP; this yields the structure in (14b).In linguistics, a marker is a free or bound morpheme that indicates the grammatical function of the marked word, phrase, or sentence. More characteristically, markers occur as clitics or inflectional affixes. In analytic languages and agglutinative languages, markers are generally easily distinguished. In fusional languages and polysynthetic languages, this is often not the case. For example, in Latin, a highly fusional language, the word amo (I love) is marked by suffix-o for indicative mood, active voice, first person, singular, present tense. Analytic languages tend to have a relatively limited number of markers. Markers should be distinguished from the linguistic concept of markedness. An unmarked form is the basic neutral form of a word, typically used as its dictionary lemma, such as—in English—for nouns the singular (e.g. cat versus cats), and for verbs the infinitive (e.g. to eat versus eats, ate and eaten)

what is a durable special power of attorney	A legal device that is used to name a representative to act on your behalf is a power of attorney (“POA”). A particular type of POA is used to account for the possibility of incapacity. Limited and General Powers of Attorney. There are different types of powers of attorney. One of them is a limited power of attorney. A limited power of attorney can be molded to suit your purposes. A limited power of attorney grants the representative that you choose (the agent or attorney-in-fact) the power to act on your behalf under limited circumstances. You spell out the nature of these circumstances when you create the device. There is also a power of attorney called a general power of attorney. The agent is not limited when you create this type of power of attorney. Under a general power of attorney, the agent or attorney-in-fact can do anything that you can do. This can sound like too much power, and this is why it is possible to create a limited power of attorney instead.If a power of attorney is durable, it remains valid and in effect even if you become incapacitated and unable to make decisions for yourself. If a power of attorney document does not explicitly say that the power is durable, it ends if you become incapacitated. But wait. There is more. There are two kinds of durable powers of attorney: a durable power of attorney for finances lets you name someone to manage your financial affairs if you become incapacitated, and a durable power of attorney for health care allows someone to make medical decisions for you if you are no longer able to speak for yourself.

can you contribute to a 401k and sep ira	Contribution Limits. The contribution limits for SIMPLE IRAs are lower than 401(k) plans, so your SIMPLE IRA contribution cannot exceed the lower limit and your total contributions can't exceed the higher, 401(k) plan limit.

what are cilium	The length of a single cilium is 1-10 micrometres and width is less than 1 micrometre. Cilia are broadly divided into two types. They function separately and sometimes together: Source: Amelia Shoemark. ' Motile ' (or moving) cilia are found in the lungs, respiratory tract and middle ear.These cilia have a rhythmic waving or beating motion (see right). They work, for instance, to keep the airways clear of mucus and dirt, allowing us to breathe easily and without irritation. They also help propel sperm.hey are now recognised as playing crucial roles in a number of organs. Some act as a sensory antenna for the cell, receiving signals from other cells or fluids nearby. 1  In the kidney, for example, cilia bend with urine flow and send a signal to alert the cells that there is a flow of urine.A cilium (Latin for eyelash; the plural is cilia) is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body. There are two types of cilia: motile cilia and non-motile, or primary cilia, which typically serve as sensory organelles.In eukaryotes, motile cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia.Eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to Eukaryotic flagella, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length.otile cilia are usually present on a cell's surface in large numbers and beat in coordinated waves. 1  In humans, for example, motile cilia are found in the lining of the trachea (windpipe), where they sweep mucus and dirt out of the lungs.
what are cells in science	That's because all cells are surrounded by a structure called the cell membrane — which, much like the walls of a house, serves as a clear boundary between the cell's internal and external environments. The cell membrane is sometimes also referred to as the plasma membrane. Rather than grouping cells by their size or shape, scientists typically categorize them by how their genetic material is packaged. If the DNA within a cell is not separated from the cytoplasm, then that cell is a prokaryote. All known prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea, are single cells. In contrast, if the DNA is partitioned off in its own membrane-bound room called the nucleus, then that cell is a eukaryote. Some eukaryotes, like amoebae, are free-living, single-celled entitiesThe cell (from Latin cella, meaning small room) is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known living organisms. Cells are the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently, and are often called the building blocks of life. The study of cells is called cell biology. Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals). While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species, humans contain more than 10 trillion (10 13) cells. Most plant and animal cells are visible only under the microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres.
what are the three rivers that potawatomi settled on	Home → Information → Pittsburgh History → Three Rivers Run Through It. If cities were alive, rivers would be their arteries. Since time immemorial, rivers have been the lifeblood of civilization. The greatest cities in the world: Rome, London, Paris, Moscow-all are built on rivers. The area around the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia is known as the “Cradle of Civilization” because it is believed that settled society began there. In Pittsburgh, we owe the existence of our own city to its three rivers: The Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio.The first written descriptions of Potawatomi communities are from seventeenth-century French traders who first encountered the Potawatomis in Wisconsin. By the 1690s Potawatomis had migrated into the Chicago region, establishing small settlements along the Calumet, Chicago, and Des Plaines Rivers. Joined by kinsmen from southwestern Michigan during the first three decades of the eighteenth century, Potawatomis from the Chicago region occupied the Fox and Kankakee River valleys, gradually expanding as far south as Lake Peoria. The Potawatomis at Chicago established close political, economic, and kinship ties with the French. French fur traders were welcomed into the Potawatomi villages, where their union with Potawatomi women produced growing numbers of mixed-blood, or Métis, children. The Potawatomis at Chicago were much involved in the fur trade, first trading beaver pelts to the French, but also supplying traders with muskrat, raccoon, and otter pelts taken from the marshes along the Calumet and Kankakee Rivers.
how to spray paint using tractor supply paint	In case anyone is wondering this was the original instructable on how to spray paint the truck. http://www.instructables.com/id/Ho-to-Spray-Paint-your-jeep-and-make-an-assault-ve/. So here is the Jeep in question that was repainted using this method when it was still rocking the krylon italian olive paint. As you can see in the forth and final picture, the jeep barely drove back home in one piece. All you lack is a set of numbers on each front fender, and a name across the tailgate and it will look like a US Navy Ship LOL. Great Ible, and a great paint job! Ha I thought about it, but I actually sold the jeep about 2 months ago to fund the purchase of a 4runner.Spray your car with a coat of tractor paint, working evenly. If the paint starts to run or drip, you are spraying too much. Allow the paint to dry for at least one hour, until it is no longer tacky to the touch. Repeat step 7 two more times for a total of three paint coats. Instructions. Sand away the old paint job on your car using 80-grit dry sandpaper. The sandpaper's coarse grit will take the old paint off your car. Rub the sandpaper over your car, using a buffer if you wish, until your car shows bare metal. Cover any area of the car you don't want painted with masking tape. Spray a tractor paint primer onto your car using a spray gun. Once you've sanded down to metal, apply the primer to protect your car from rusting. Allow the primer 20 minutes to dry, and apply two more coats in the same manner. Wait one half hour to sand the primer. Plunge 350-grit wet sandpaper into a bucket to wet it
cost for heat pumps for swimming pools	Costs. Heat pumps are priced according to BTUs and COP. Prices start at $2,000 - $3,000 and go as high as $4,000 - $5,000. Heat pump operating costs vary by geographic location, desired pool temperature, and whether or not a pool cover is used. DOE estimates that keeping an outdoor pool in Miami at 80 degrees year-round costs $1,460 for an uncovered pool and $300 for a covered pool. See Table 1 on this page for a complete cost by location breakdown. Professional installation of a swimming pool heat pump is recommended and might cost $400 - $500 depending on the complexity of the installation. Heat pumps require a dedicated breaker and most of the installation work is electrical, so it makes sense to hire an electrician (or qualified pool professional) for the jobTo make sure you are getting the right heat pump pool heater for your pool and budget, we need to look at the efficiency ratings and BTU sizes. Heat pump pool heater efficiency ratings use a scale called coefficient of performance (C.O.P.). The higher the C.O.P., the more money you will save on your pool heating cost. Heat pump swimming pool heaters for in ground and above ground swimming pools will make the water more enjoyable for all your swimming activities at the lowest heating cost! Reduce your pool heating cost to about half of the cost of gas swimming pool heaters! Pool heat pump heaters are very energy efficient! They can provide all the pool heating you need for a pool or spa! Adding a pool heat pump is truly one of the wisest investments you could make for your pool in any climate
good reason for remission	If the doctor says that you are in remission, that's good news. If you are lucky, cancer becomes something like a chronic disease that you have controlled so that life is still pretty normal and the disease is not the center of your life. 1  Login or register to post comments. Re: Remission. I have been told that stage 4 cancer can't be cured, but that doesn't mean it can't be treated or that you can't go into remission. Remission means that the beast seems to be gone. It means the tumors have disappeared and aren't bothering you anymore.If you have been imprisoned and part of your sentence is remitted, this means that you do not have to remain in prison for the full period of your sentence. For example, if you have been sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment, you may be released after 6 years. In other words, the remaining 2 years of your sentence are remitted. Temporary release means that you are released from prison for a specified period of time for a specific purpose or reason. Remission. Under Rule 59 of the Prison Rules 2007 as amended, the vast majority of prisoners serving sentences are entitled to remission at a rate of one quarter. In practice, this means that a person sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment will be expected to serve 3 years in custody. However, part of this remission may be cancelled as disciplinary punishment. Whether or not you get remission depends on your good behaviour while you are in prison. On application by a prisoner, the Minister for Justice and Equality can grant enhanced remission of up to one third of the sentence

how deep to plant sugar beets	1 Plant sugar beet seeds about 1½ inches (3.8 centimeters) deep in the soil. 2  Don't plant them too close to each other, as the roots can get intertwined. 3  Cover the seeds with a layer of soil. 4  When weeding around the beets, be careful, as the roots of the sugar beets are shallow and you can easily damage them. 1 Don't till the soil more than a month before planting, or the soil will get too dry. 2  Plant sugar beet seeds about 1½ inches (3.8 centimeters) deep in the soil. 3  Don't plant them too close to each other, as the roots can get intertwined. 4  Cover the seeds with a layer of soilSugar beets are primarily grown as a commercial crop, but are also well-suited to the home garden. They take up very little space in beds. The sugary roots can be used in vegetable dishes as well as in home wine and molasses production. The leafy tops are often added to feed for livestock and add necessary fiber to the animal's diet. Plant beets in the spring for a late summer or early autumn harvest. Prepare a well-drained bed for planting. Work the soil at least 10 inches deep to give the beet root plenty of room to grow. Work compost into the soil to raise the bed three inches to improve drainage if necessary. Sow the seeds after danger of frost has passed in the spring. Sow each seed one-half inch deep and cover loosely with soil. Step 1. Prepare a well-drained bed for planting. Work the soil at least 10 inches deep to give the beet root plenty of room to grow. Work compost into the soil to raise the bed three inches to improve drainage if necessary.

how old do you have to be to babysit in oklahoma	Police say an 8-year-old was supposed to be babysitting their little brother when somehow the 3-year-old left the house. This has many people questioning what age is a good age to leave kids alone. In Oklahoma, there's no law that says how old a person must be to watch a child. At Tulsa's Red Cross, there's a babysitting class that teaches kids the basic fundamentals of taking care of a younger child. Children are going to mature at different times in their life and some will be very responsible and capable at age 9 and some won't have that ability until they're older than 11, she said. Quesnel said the key to successful babysitting is to make sure you never take your eye off the child.answer 2: I also live in Michigan, and believe it or not, you could be 8 years old and babysit! There are only 2 states with staying home alo … ne laws, and Michigan is not one of them. It is recommended though, to be at least 10 years old due to maturity reasons. 1 person found this useful. Although certification is not required under the Oklahoma babysitting laws, many teens chose to take a babysitter training class offered by the American Red Cross. The class covers what to do in emergencies, as well as how to amuse children and change diapers. There is no law in Oklahoma on the age for babysitters. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, babysitting is one of the few jobs that teens under the age of 14 may legally accept. The Red Cross course is aimed at youngsters ages 11 to 15. Many experts recommend that babysitters be at least 12 or 13 years old

The recommendation is to take Cialis 30 minutes prior to sexual activity, while with Viagra and Levitra, users are instructed to take the drug 60 minutes before sexual activity. Generally, the effects of Cialis last 24 to 36 hours after taking it. The fact that the effects are so long-lasting has been a major selling point for Cialis, which branded itself “the weekend pill.” Many men like that they can take Cialis Friday night, and still experience its effects Sunday morning. Cialis: How to Take it and How Long it Lasts. Posted by: Mary Hiers in Cialis April 8, 2014 Comments Off on Cialis: How to Take it and How Long it Lasts 28329 Views. Cialis is a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Cialis is among the top 100 selling drugs in the world.Cialis is the trade name for a drug called Tadalafil. Cialis is one of a class of drugs known as PDE-5 (Phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitors. Cialis and the other PDE-5 inhibitors can help men with erectile dysfunction (male impotence) by enhancing the erectile response when a man is sexually stimulated. Cialis can remain effective for up to 36 hours. This does not mean that the erection will last that long-simply that you will have the ability to attain an improved erection for that period of time. Unlike Viagra, a meal will not delay the effectiveness of Cialis
how to show different screens on laptop and monitor	You can leave your email open on one monitor, for example, while composing a business document on the other. To get the monitors to show different things, each monitor must be attached to a separate video port on your computer. Step 1. Attach the second monitor to the extra VGA or DVI port on your computer. Most new desktops have two VGA or DVI video outputs, while laptops have an external video port that you can use with a second monitor. You can also use an HDMI port to connect a second display. Step 2. Right-click on the Windows desktop, and select Screen Resolution from the pop-up menu. Select the monitor you want to use as your main display, and then check the box next to Make This My Main Display.. The main display contains the left half of the extended desktop. When you move your cursor to the right edge of the main display, it jumps to the second monitor. Step 5.Connect the monitor, flat panel, or projector to the laptop's external video connection on the back of the computer. An example of a VGA connector for a computer monitor and VGA port on a laptop is shown to the right. Once connected, your laptop may automatically switch to the new external display, or you may be required to press a key or keys on the keyboard to switch to the external display. Some laptops can output video to both the laptop and the external display, or to a single display at a time. Laptops with this feature can toggle between the two modes when the appropriate function key is pressed. Tip: Newer laptops and monitors may use a DVI or HDMI connection.
what volts should a alternator charge at	To charge the battery, the alternator voltage output has to exceed a minimum charging voltage. This minimum charging voltage is 13.8 volts dc across the battery terminals, or at the output of the alternator. A single lead-acid cell starts to charge at anything over 2.25 volts. Since a 12 volt battery has six cells, any 12 volt lead-acid battery needs at least 13.8 volts to start to charge. This voltage will be enough to fully charge or maintain the battery on a trickle charge, but charging time will be very long at 13.8 volts. To fully charge in reasonable times, alternator output must be 14.2 V to 14.5 V as measured right across the battery posts. Above 14.5 volts charging voltage, batteries have a greatly increased tendency to release excessive acidic vapors, hydrogen gas, and to corrode things around the batteryA fully charged car battery has 12.6 volts. There is a very big difference when a car battery voltage drops even a small amount of voltage. When a car drops, for instance, from 12.6 to 12.0, there will be 75% difference. Its power drops from 100% to 25%. At 12.4 volts, a car battery is 75% charged while at 12.2 volts its 50% charged. Consider your car battery charged at 12.4 volts or higher and discharged at 12.39 volts or less. It is important that you first check the battery plus the charging system output (alternator). The alternator may not be putting out enough current to keep the battery charged if the charging voltage is less than 13.5 volts. Make sure the alternator is tested (can be tested at an auto parts store).
why is it not possible to balance an equation by changing the subscript on a substance	An equation is balanced by changing coefficients in a somewhat trial-and-error fashion. It is important to note that only the coefficients can be changed, NEVER a subscript. The coefficient times the subscript gives the total number of atoms. Three quick examples before balancing the equation. You cannot change the oxygen's subscript in water from one to two, as in: H 2 + O 2 2 O 2. True, this balances the equation, but you have changed the substances in it. H 2 O 2 is a completely different substance from H 2 O. 2) You cannot place a coefficient in the middle of a formula.Answer 1 To balance an equation means that there are the same number of each element on each side. The reason a subscript cannot change is that it represents the amount of an … element within a certain compound in relation to any other elements. If that ratio changes, it is no longer the same compound. Changing a subscript changes a formula so that it no longer stands for the correct substance. Answer 2 The point of balancing an equation is to find the ratios in which chemicals will react or be produced. By changing the equation, you change the reaction. Therefore you are not trying to balance the same reaction. Answer 3 A balanced chemical equation is the standard way of writing equations for chemical reactants because it follows the LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS. A subscript in the formula can not be changed when balancing an equation because changing a subscript would make the formula describe a different compound, or rather more likely a non-existent compound.

Since the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment.The calf muscles. The gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris muscles are known as the calf muscles. They form the superficial muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg. The deep muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg are the popliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus. The gastrocnemius calf muscle is the most superficial of the calf muscles. It inserts onto the heel bone via the Achilles tendon.

what temperature do i need to bake puff pastry	I assume you are add pastry to the top of an oven proof dish filled with your chicken pie! Simple: Have your rolled pastry ready in the fridge. If you're using the pre-rolled pastry-about 3mm thick-leave it as is. If you're buying a block roll it out to 3mm thick-see tips. Make sure your pie filling is hot. Pour the filling directly from your sauce pan into the oven proof dish. Lay your pastry over the top, trim it if you want. Brush the top of the pie with egg wash (30% milk 70% egg beaten). Put it into the oven-which should be preheated-and bake @ 200C/390F for 20-25mins. If you oven is fan assisted set it to 180C/350F. ref: http://powerhungry.com/2009/02/puff-pastry-docking/. 2) In general, to cook food more evenly, one should cook longer at a lower temperature. The problem is that the dough on the bottom of your crust is not reaching a high enough temperature by the time the top of your crust is done cooking.Don't even think about baking puff pastry in the microwave or toaster oven. It just doesn't work. Baking temperatures vary. Most pastry chefs agree with the instructions on the box -- bake puff pastry at a high temperature for a short time, usually at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. When the pastry is high and golden brown, it is done. Here are some tips for working with ready-made puff pastry. Thaw frozen pastry sheets at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before gently unfolding. Wrap unused sheets in plastic wrap or foil and return to the freezer. Always preheat the oven prior to baking as directed in the recipe.
what is bluestone used for	Brief Synopsis: A list of uses for Copper Sulfate, also known as Bluestone, including historical home remedies, medical cures, and industrial use. Bluestone is frequently encountered as an ingredient in mojo hands made by African-American hoodoo doctors, especially those for gamblers' luck and protection from evil.. Copper Sulphate is a widely used chemical compound comprised of Copper, Sulphur and Oxygen whose formula is CuSO4. Crystals of Copper Sulphate are often bright blue and the substance was known once as Blue Vitriol or Bluestone. Copper sulfate was used in the past as an emetic, (An agent that induces vomiting). 1 Athletes Foot or Tinea-Add a teaspoon of bluestone to a basin or bucket of warm water and soak your feet for around 10 minutes. 2  May sting a bit initially, but will kill the fungi. ( 3 Copper Sulphate is very corrosive so it should not be used in metal foot baths).Pennsylvania Bluestone is a unique sand stone found only in Northeastern Pennsylvania and mostly in Susquehanna County. Pennsylvania Bluestone derives its name from its typically blue color. It is marketed in two types: dimensional (architectural grade) used for stairsteps, window and door fixtures, countertops, and tabletops, and flagstone, which is used for walkways and patios. Landscapers use Pennsylvania Bluestone to create walls, steps, sidewalks, patios and as a complimentary material in building facades. Pennsylvania Bluestone is also used in interior decorating for fireplaces, countertops, flooring, lamps and other architectural details.
where is the epigastrium located	In anatomy, the epigastrium (or epigastric region) is the upper central region of the abdomen. It is located between the costal margins and the subcostal plane. The epigastrium is one of the nine regions of the abdomen, along with the right and left hypochondria, right and left lateral regions (lumbar areas or flanks), right and left inguinal regions (or fossae), and the umbilical and pubic regions. During breathing the diaphragm contracts and flattens, displacing the viscera and producing an outward movement of the upper abdominal wall (epigastric region). It is a convergence of the diaphragm and the abdominals, so that when both sets of muscles (diaphragm and abdominals) tense, the epigastrium pushes forward.The abdomen is divided into nine different anatomical regions. The epigastrium is the name given to the central upper part of the abdomen, and is located between two regions called the left and right hypochondria. The central abdominal section includes the left lumbar, umbilical, and right lumbar regions. Gastritis is one of the most common health problems that affects the epigastrium. One problem that affects the epigastrium is gastritis, which may develop as a result of infection with Helicobacter pylori. The pancreas, which secretes digestive enzymes, and the duodenum are located within the epigastrium. An epigastric hernia may occur below the ribcage and above the navel. Surgery may be required to treat an epigastric hernia. Gastritis caused by the excessive use of alcohol is a problem that can affect the epigastrium
what did the factory system effect	The factory first adopted in England at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century and later spread abroad. It replaced the putting-out system. The main characteristic of the factory system is the use of machinery, originally powered by water or steam and later by electricity. Other characteristics of the system mostly derive from the use of machinery or economies of scale, the centralization of factories, and standardization of interchangeable parts. In other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Until the late 19th century it was common to work 12 hours a day, six days a week in most factories; however long hours were also common outside factories.(Answer #1). As more people in the United States went to work in factories, the social structures that had bound Americans together became weaker. America had been a more communal society with informal social structures. With the coming of factories, it became a more rationalized society with more formal structures. Before the factories, people worked out of their own homes. They typically produced most of the things they needed and traded for the few things they did not produce. They lived in places where everyone knew everyone else. With the rise of factories, all of this changed. Work and home became separate places and ideas. People no longer lived in small communities with a relatively few people who knew them. Informal social pressures could not keep order among large groups of people who did not know one another well.
formation of a limestone pavement geography gcse	The water attacks the many joints and bedding planes in the rock, through the chemical weathering processes of carbonation and solution. There are a number of distinctive features seen in karst scenery areas, both on and beneath the surface. 1  Limestone pavements are large areas of exposed limestone. Uses of a carboniferous limestone area. 1  Poor, thin soils mean that the only type of farming possible in limestone areas is sheep grazing. 2  The tourist industry is a very important source of income to limestone areas. 3  Most people come to walk in the hills and see the spectacular karst sceney.During periods of glaciation, glacial abrasion has scraped away the topsoil to expose the bare rock underneath. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is made up of horizontal cracks called bedding planes and vertical cracks called joints. Limestone is made of Calcium Carbonate which is dissolved by rainfall which is a weak acid. This process is called chemical weathering. As a result of these features water is able to seep down through the cracks and into the rock making it seem to disappear. Therefore limestone is said to be a permeable rock. A limestone pavement is formed when rain water seeps through the joints and dissolves the limestone on each side making the joint wider. As the processes of dissolving limestone and cavern formation continue over time then caverns get larger and larger. Eventually there will be less rock supporting the roof of the cavern and it will collapse. This forms a very steep-sided valley called a gorge.
how much does it cost to build a greenhouse for bananas	But you don’t have to use it as a greenhouse. It can be a guest house or an energy-efficient small home. The design is flexible, so you can incorporate whatever recycled materials you can find. Even if you buy some of the materials and hire a bit of help, you can build a greenhouse for about $3,800. If you plan to use the building as a greenhouse, use insulated, wood-framed windows that aren’t coated with low-e or solar film, because the coating limits heat gain. To build your own greenhouse, start with a level building site, but make sure the site slopes enough to drain water from the building. Then cover the area where you’ll build the greenhouse with a weed barrier and gravel. Make a 10-foot-by-12-foot grid (on center) of concrete deck pads — three rows of four pads. Put a 10-foot rot-resistant 2-by-4 (flat, not on edge) on the short rowsIn fact, it is usually best to spend the time to seek out and communicate with contractors who have already built such projects. For the purpose of this conversation we will consider the costs and requirements for the construction of a greenhouse on a residential lot. According to the Craftsman National Building Cost Estimator program, the pricing on a greenhouse measuring 12'x12' would be around $3587, or $25 per square foot. 1 This might be problematic in areas of heavy frost, however); 2  Concrete-the knee walls and flooring of the greenhouse would demand roughly 3.5 cubic yards of concrete. 3  This is priced at an average of $75 per cubic yard, and with labor would cost around $540;
what is payload capacity	For instance, they often calculate this number by supposing that nothing is in the truck except for a 150-pound (68-kg) driver. In realistic situations, where the driver may be heavier, other passengers are in the cab and extra cargo is in the bed, the truck's actual towing capacity is lower [source: Edmunds ]. It turns out that not only do half-ton pickups weigh and carry more than a half ton, they can also tow more than a half ton. Although payload capacity usually refers to how much weight a truck can carry in both passengers and cargo in the cab and bed, towing capacity refers to how much the truck can safely tow. Although different, these two parameters can affect each other. For instance, the payload can include the tongue weight, which is the portion of trailer weight -- usually about 15 percent -- that bears down on the truck's hitch. Manufacturers often embellish the maximum towing capacity of a truck in advertisementsPayload is the carrying capacity of an aircraft or launch vehicle, usually measured in terms of weight. Depending on the nature of the flight or mission, the payload of a vehicle may include cargo, passengers, flight crew, munitions, scientific instruments or experiments, or other equipment. Extra fuel, when optionally carried, is also considered part of the payload. When the weight of the payload and fuel are considered together, it is known as the  useful load fraction . In spacecraft, mass fraction is normally used, which is the ratio of payload to everything else, including the rocket structure.
how long does it take to get your federal return back	Filing a return through the mail is, of course, the slower of the two processes. For those who mail their federal return, the IRS will remit a tax refund within six weeks after they have been received the completed return. If you file electronically, you should receive your tax refund within three weeks. The IRS allows two options for receiving a federal tax refund: paper check sent via the mail, or an electronic funds transfer (also called a direct deposit). The direct deposit method, not surprisingly, is always the quicker option. For anyone wanting to check the status of their tax refund, simply go to the IRS's Where's my refund webpage where you'll find an easy to use tool to request the information. If you would rather check the refund status by phone, you may call 1-800-829-1954. The IRS asks that you wait 3 days after filing electronically, or 3 weeks after mailing a return before checking for a status updateHow long will your tax refund take and how much will you get back? The IRS started accepting returns on January 20, but refunds may take longer than normal this year. If you haven’t filed yet, get an idea of how much your refund check will be for with the tax refund calculator below. Time to go shopping. Finally got my Tax Refund. Refunds are normally issued within approximately 21 days if you use e-File, but you may have to wait a bit longer this year due to staff cutbacks within the IRS. Mailing your return in and requesting a paper check is the least speedy choice, slowing down your refund by several weeks.

at what age are mammograms covered by insurance	The law requires Medicare to cover a yearly mammography screening at no cost to women starting at age 40. For private insurance plans, the law also requires coverage of mammograms, with no cost-sharing, every one to two years for women starting at age 40. For seniors, this is a step up in benefits: Before the health care law, mammograms were also covered, but with 20 percent cost-sharing. Does Obamacare limit the number of times women get a mammogram and at what age? FULL ANSWER. Several readers have asked us questions, such as those listed above, about whether the Affordable Care Act would limit their ability to get a mammogram, or if insurance or Medicare wouldn’t cover mammograms under the law.The Affordable Care Act actually improves coverage of mammograms for Medicare beneficiaries and an unknown number of women on private insurance, depending on what their insurance covered previously. The law requires Medicare to cover a yearly mammography screening at no cost to women starting at age 40. For private insurance plans, the law also requires coverage of mammograms, with no cost-sharing, every one to two years for women starting at age 40. For seniors, this is a step up in benefits: Before the healthcare law, mammograms were also covered, but with 20 percent cost-sharing. Short answer: No. In fact, the law requires insurers to cover mammography — with no cost-sharing — every one to two years for women starting at age 40. Medicare fully pays for mammograms once every 12 months with no upper age limit. Full questions.

how do you know how many decimal places a terminating decimal will have	Your non zero digits will be 2^6 = 64 i.e. you will have 2 non-zero digits. Another way to look at the problem is this: 1/(10^11 * 5^6) = 2^6/(10^17) (multiply and divide by 2^6). = 64/(10^17). Since the denominator is a power of 10, it will just move the decimal 17 places to the left. The non-zero digits will remain 64 only i.e. 2 digits. Answer (B). We will look at some DS questions on terminating and non terminating decimals next week. There has to be another logical approach to this problem. Well, here it is: A fraction in its lowest term can be expressed as a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator has powers of only 2 and/or 5. Let’s try to understand the logic behind it. Say, a and b are two integers. a/b = a * 1/b. For a/b to be terminating, 1/b must be a terminating decimalAny rational number (that is, a fraction in lowest terms) can be written as either a terminating decimal or a repeating decimal. Just divide the numerator by the denominator. If you end up with a remainder of 0, then you have a terminating decimal. Otherwise, the remainders will begin to repeat after some point, and you have a repeating decimal. Example: Convert the fraction 5/8 to a decimal. The division is as follows: So, 5/8 = 0.625. This is a terminating decimal. Example: Convert the fraction 7/12 to a decimal. The division is as follows: So: This is a repeating decimal. The bar over the number, in this case 3, indicates the number or block of numbers that repeat unendingly. See also Converting Repeating Decimals to Fractions

what is the difference between gastritis and peptic ulcer disease	Ulcers and gastritis are considerably different from each other. Gastritis is a disease of the stomach in which there is an inflammation. There is inflammation because there is too much secretion of gastric juices. Ulcers, on the other hand, is a scarring of the surface of an organ or even the skin. But the vomit’s color depends on the extent of the damage unlike in ulcers which is bloody. Both conditions are treatable with medications and antibiotics. Summary: 1.Gastritis is the inflammation of the stomach while an ulcer is the erosion of the surface of the stomach or even the gastrointestinal tract. 2.Ulcers and gastritis can be mainly caused by bacteria, but ulcers can be caused by stressGastritis can be a cause of H.pylori, a bacteria, that can thrive in the stomach. This bacteria when it multiplies into the millions will definitely cause infection. Another cause of gastritis is by taking NSAIDS or pain relievers as well as aspirin. These drugs reduce the capacity of prostaglandin to protect the stomach from too much acidic reaction. Ulcers or peptic ulcers or peptic ulcer disease, PUD, is also a gastrointestinal disease. But the vomit’s color depends on the extent of the damage unlike in ulcers which is bloody. Both conditions are treatable with medications and antibiotics. Summary: 1.Gastritis is the inflammation of the stomach while an ulcer is the erosion of the surface of the stomach or even the gastrointestinal tract. 2.Ulcers and gastritis can be mainly caused by bacteria, but ulcers can be caused by stress
what makes tequila so strong	From The Webtender Wiki. Tequila is a strong distilled alcoholic beverage produced from fermented Agave plant, made primarily in the area surrounding Tequila, a town in the western Mexican state of Jalisco, 50 km from Guadalajara. It is made from the agave plant (also called maguey) - a succulent, similar to the lily, which is native to Mexico. There are, however, premium tequilas made from 100% blue agave. If it is not made from 100% agave, tequila is called mixto. Tequila made only from agave sugars must be made in Mexico, and is marked Hecho en Mexico (méxico made In). mexicoTequila is an alcoholic beverage made through a distillation process involving the blue agave plant which is grown in Mexico. Pure Tequila is made solely from the agave plant, but some varieties of this drink are mixed with other ingredients, like corn, to come up with a different taste or save costs. As an alcoholic drink, Tequila has the reputation of being a strong drink. With Tequila bottles formulated with up to 40 percent alcohol, in itself it is a strong liquor. But aside from its alcohol content, many people also consider Tequila as a strong drink because of its taste. The bitter and sour flavor of this alcoholic beverage literally makes the impression that this drink is a strong one. And when flavors are smooth, they also give the sense of strength to the alcoholic drink. Some alcoholic beverage lovers also think that Tequila is stronger because of its color. With these drinkers, the drink color is usually associated with its strength.
what is mean by non decreasing order	Non-decreasing means exactly that. It's not quite the same as increasing, since it does not tell you what to do with identical values. Consider the sequence 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. It's a non-decreasing sequence because the values are in order, yet do not strictly increase from value to value (ie, 2 is not greater than 2). Increasing means that every element is greater than the one before it. Non-decreasing means that no element is less than the element before it, or in other words: that every element is greater than or equal to the one before it. share | improve this answer.In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2). If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing. Two facts about these functions are: 1  if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.
oven temperature and time for beef roast	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make a dry rub by combining chili powder, salt, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, sugar, dry mustard, and bay leaf. Season the raw brisket on both sides with the rub. Place in a roasting pan and roast, uncovered, for 1 hour. Add beef stock and enough water to yield about 1/2 inch of liquid in the roasting pan. Lower oven to 300 degrees F, cover pan tightly and continue cooking for 3 hours, or until fork-tender. Trim the fat and slice meat thinly across the grain. Top with juice from the pan.4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 1 hour 45 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour 30 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°
what do doctors look for in blood work	Overview. Blood tests are very common. When you have routine checkups, your doctor may recommend blood tests to see how your body is working. Many blood tests don't require any special preparations. For some, you may need to fast (not eat any food) for 8 to 12 hours before the test. Your doctor will let you know how to prepare for blood tests. During a blood test, a small sample of blood is taken from your body. It's usually drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. A finger prick also might be used. The procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort.Samples collected for cancer blood tests are analyzed in a lab for signs of cancer. The samples may show cancer cells, proteins or other substances made by the cancer. Blood tests can also give your doctor an idea of how well your organs are functioning and if they've been affected by cancer. Examples of blood tests used to diagnose cancer include: 1  Complete blood count (CBC). 2  This common blood test measures the amount of various types of blood cells in a sample of your blood. 3  Blood cancers may be detected using this test if too many or too few of a type of blood cell or abnormal cells are found. 1 This common blood test measures the amount of various types of blood cells in a sample of your blood. 2  Blood cancers may be detected using this test if too many or too few of a type of blood cell or abnormal cells are found. 3  A bone marrow biopsy may help confirm a diagnosis of a blood cancer. 4  Blood protein testing
where can magnesium be mined	The Pidgeon process is most commonly used for production of magnesium due to the fact that its operation is relatively easy, versatile and has low capital cost. This process is also high in energy consumption and has low productivity.In this process, magnesium is collected from a condenser on the outside of a furnace.High priority magnesium can be attained from the condenser since vapor pressure of impurities that may be in the magnesium are low under the conditions of the tank. The largest producers of magnesium are China, Russia and Canada.n this process, magnesium is collected from a condenser on the outside of a furnace.

what does the ecm trap for cell strength	The Extracellular Matrix (ECM). While it is true that all living things are made of cells, that is only part of the story. Most of the cells in multicellular organisms are surrounded by a complex mixture of nonliving material that makes up the extracellular matrix (ECM). In some cases, the ECM accounts for more of the organism's bulk than its cells. 1  In plants, the ECM is primarily composed of cellulose. [ Link to a discussion. 1 In vertebrates, the ECM is made of a complex mixture of carbohydrates and proteins (plus minerals in the case of bone). 2  It is the ECM of vertebrates that will be discussed on this page.The integrity of tissues is also dependent on the adhesion, by CAMs, of cells to cells and cells to the Extracellular Matrix. Extracellular matrix (ECM) All cells in solid tissue are surrounded by extracellular matrix. Both plants and animals have ECM. The cell wall of plant cells is a type of extracellular matrix. In animals, the ECM can surround cells as fibrils that contact the cells on all sides, or as a sheet called the basement membrane that cells ‘sit on’. Cells in animals are also linked directly to each other by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at the cell surface. ECM is composed of proteins and polysaccharides. Connective tissue is largely ECM together with a few cells. 1  For cells ECM provides: 2  mechanical support. 3  a biochemical barrier. 4  a medium for: 5  extracellular communication that is assisted by CAMs. 6  the stable positioning of cells in tissues through cell matrix adhesion
what CBC panel for liver function	A liver (hepatic) function panel is a blood test to check how well the liver is working. This test measures the blood levels of total protein, albumin, bilirubin, and liver enzymes. High or low levels may mean that liver damage or disease is present. The liver serves several important functions in the body, including changing nutrients into energy for the body and breaking down toxic substances. Your doctor may order a liver function panel if you have symptoms of liver disease. These symptoms include fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin (jaundice), dark yellow urine, and feeling very tired. This blood test also may be done if you have recently been exposed to a hepatitis virus or are taking a medicine that may cause liver damage. To learn more, see: 1  Total Protein. 2  Albumin. 3  Bilirubin (total and direct). 4  Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) . 5  Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) . 6  Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) .DESCRIPTION: The Liver Function Panel (Hepatic Function) measures the blood levels of seven tests that you may want to check to see how well your liver is working. Your doctor may order it if you’re suffering from symptoms related to liver disease or if you regularly take medicine, which can affect the liver. High or low levels in one of the seven tests in the Liver Function Panel (Hepatic Function) may indicate that liver damage or liver disease is present. If you’re taking medicine or if you’ve been exposed to hepatitis, this test is typically recommended by your physician
redwood decking cost per linear foot	In most regions of the country, redwood and cedar each cost at least three times more than pressure-treated lumber. For example, I recently bought an 8-ft.-long red cedar 2 x 6 and paid nearly $4 per linear foot--ouch! Both species are considerably less expensive on the West Coast. In California, for instance, a B-grade redwood 2 x 6 costs about $2.35 per linear foot. Redwood and cedar require an annual power washing and coat of finish every three to four years. Prices vary because there are so many different companies, but composites are typically less expensive than plastic lumber. For example, for 5/4 x 6-­in. decking, expect to pay about $2.50 per linear foot for composites, and $3 per linear foot for plastic lumber. Most composite decking and plastic lumber manufacturers also offer a line of handrails, balusters, fascias and other decorative trimRoutinely staining your deck will help protect your deck but it is not uncommon for pressure treated decking to split, crack, warp, and turn gray in a few years. Cedar and redwood decking prices range from about $1.25 to $2.00 per linear foot for 5/4x6 stock. Redwood is commonly available on the west coast but is scarce in the eastern United States. Higher grade materials and long lengths will cost a premium. With over 100 brands to choose from there is a wide range of prices for vinyl and composite decking. The higher end name brands usually cost between $3.00 to $4.00 per linear foot. The big box stores offer economy composite materials for about half the price.
when the car wos invented	by Tomo · January 19, 2011. The first car which was steam powered was invented by Ferdinand Verbiest in 1672 in China. Nicholas Cugnot was the one to design and build the first car that was self propelled in 1769 which had three wheels.A Swiss inventor, Francois Isaac Rivaz, designed and invented the first car that used the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen as a fuel, the car with an internal combustion engine in the year 1806.The car was not successful. It was in the year 1885 that a car run by gasoline was designed and built by Karl Benz, in Germany.The car got its patent in 1886. He was the one to be considered as the inventor of the first car. His inventions also add an in built combustion flat engine car, eleven years later, in 1896. Swiss inventor, Francois Isaac Rivaz, designed and invented the first car that used the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen as a fuel, the car with an internal combustion engine in the year 1806. The car was not successful.The first car was invented in the year of 1769 by a French man named Nicolas Joseph Cugnot, who build it under his instructions in the Paris Arsenal by Mechanic Brezin.The ca … r only had 3 wheels and was used to carry heavy artilary during war. The car could go up to about 22 miles per hour and was powered by steam.t is argued that this constitutes the first 'car' ever invented, but the design was only 65cm long, had no seats or pilot controls, and was intended as little more than a toy. Further, there is little evidence that the invention was ever actually built.
japan is often called	In Japanese Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Meri Kurisumasu'. And it's written in the two Japanese scripts like this; Hiragana: めりーくりすます; Katakana: メリークリスマス. Happy/Merry Christmas in lots more languages. Parties are often held for children, with games and dancing. Japanese Christmas Cake is a sponge cake decorated with trees, flowers and a figure of Santa Claus. In Japan Santa is known as サンタさん、サンタクロース santa-san (Mr Santa). Another Japanese gift bringer is Hoteiosho, a Japanese god of good fortune from Buddhism and not really related to Christmas. Fried chicken is often eaten on Christmas day. In Japan, Christmas in known as more of a time to spread happiness rather than a religious celebration. Christmas eve is often celebrated more than Christmas Day. Christmas eve is thought of as a romantic day, in which couples spend together and exchange presents.When romanised, this pause is represented by a doubling of the first consonant of the second syllable; thus nichi 日 plus kō 光 (light) is written and pronounced nikkō, meaning sunlight. The initial consonant of non-initial syllables in compounds often becomes voiced in Japanese, in a process called rendaku. Non-initial hon in compounds thus often changes to bon or pon. There are therefore two possible pronunciations for 日本: Nihon or Nippon. In Korean, Japan is called Ilbon (일본/日本), which is the Korean pronunciation of the Sino-Korean name, and in Sino-Vietnamese, Japan is called Nhật Bản (also rendered as Nhựt Bổn). Ue-kok (倭國) is recorded for older Hokkien speakers.
what does matters relating to contract means	Instead of establishing an unduly narrow set—the contract—and relying on a vague standard to reach beyond it, you establish the relevant set—activities under the contract. But plenty of courts have had occasion to assess the meaning of arising out of or relating to in the context of arbitration provisions. If you elect to stick with arising out of or relating to rather than articulating clearly your intended meaning, you’re opting for deficient contract language. You’re relying on courts to breathe meaning into your contract language rather than electing to establish that meaning yourself. By the way, another possible reason for using arising out of or relating to is that you want to capture not just the subject matter of the contract but also other activitieThe phrase arising out of or relating to is a fixture of contracts. It’s primarily associated with governing-law provisions and arbitration provisions. Contracts routinely state—the wording varies—that the governing law of the contract covers all matters “arising out of or relating to” that contract.

what is https used for	These error messages, also called HTTP status codes are response codes given by Web servers and help identify the cause of the problem. For example, 404 File Not Found is a common HTTP status code. It means the Web server cannot find the file you requested. The file -- the webpage or other document you try to load in your Web browser -- has either been moved or deleted, or you entered the wrong URL or document name. Knowing the meaning of the HTTP status code can help you figure out what went wrong. HTTP: A Stateless Protocol. HTTP is called a stateless protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. This is the main reason that it is difficult to implement Web sites that react intelligently to user input.Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms. All communications sent over regular HTTP connections are in 'plain text' and can be read by any hacker that manages to break into the connection between your browser and the website. This presents a clear danger if the 'communication' is on an order form and includes your credit card details or social security number.
cost of building a house per square foot in ontario	1. Local building permit costs & lay of property: Depending on what municipality/region you build in, pricing for building & development costs can range from as low as $10,000 to $30,000. For example, on a 1,800 square foot home, this translates to a difference of $11.00 per square foot. Building a house on a low-grade property most likely requires extra work in regards to raising the grade and bringing in extra loads of fill. An estimate is just that: 'an estimate;' until a clearer picture of what is being built, by whom, and where, is finalized. Generally, we find the 'price per square foot' rate to be around: •$110-$130 per square foot to build a house your own (self build). •$160 - $200 per square foot to hire a custom home builder.1.

average stride length for a man	Some models ask for users to input their height and weight, which will determine your estimated stride length for you. Step 4. Determine your estimated stride by using the average stride lengths for men and women. An average man's stride length is 78 centimeters, while a woman's average stride length is 70 centimeters. Step 5. Measure your stride length by marking off a 50-foot-long area on a sidewalk or in your driveway, using a piece of chalk. Walk from one end of this area to the other, while counting your steps. Determine your stride length using your height. While this is not as accurate as some other methods, it can give you a close estimate of your stride length. For women, simply multiply 0.413 by your height in centimeters. Men should multiply 0.415 by theiThe Numbers. Stride length is measured from heel to heel and determines how far you walk with each step. On average, a man's walking stride length is 2.5 feet, or 30 inches, according to Arizona State University Extension. A woman's average stride length is 2.2 feet, or 26.4 inches, reports the school. In general, people with longer legs have a greater stride length than those with shorter legs. How Far You'll Go. Stride length is useful for determining how far you'll walk in a given number of steps. At the average stride length, a man walks a mile in roughly 2,100 steps, according to the ExRx.net steps-to-distance calculator. The calculator also estimates that with the average woman's stride length, you'll walk a mile in about 2,400 step

name the structure in the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with the blood?	In humans and other mammals, the anatomical features of the respiratory system include trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, and diaphragm. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide are passively exchanged, by diffusion, between the gaseous external environment and the blood. This exchange process occurs in the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs. In fish and many invertebrates, respiration takes place through the gills. The major function of the respiratory system is gas exchange between the external environment and an organism's circulatory system. In humans and other mammals, this exchange facilitates oxygenation of the blood with a concomitant removal of carbon dioxide and other gaseous metabolic wastes from the circulation.Oxygen-carbon dioxide-The process by which oxygen passes from the air in the LUNGS to the HEMOGLOBIN in the BLOOD, and carbon dioxide from the hemoglobin passes into the air in the lungs. Oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange is fundamental to life and is the primary function of the lungs. Oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange takes place between the alveoli, the tiny bubblelike sacs deep within the lungs, and the capillaries, the tiniest blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. Oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules (as well as the molecules of other gases such as nitrogen and highly toxic carbon monoxide) can easily pass through the walls of the alveoli and the capillaries, moving in the direction of least resistance. Oxygen molecules move from the alveoli into the capillaries with inhalation.
what food are acidic and alkaline	As a result, different charts can report slightly different pH levels of the same foods. Download this printable Alkaline-Acid Food Chart to post on your fridge. Jump To Featured Products. How the body reacts to certain foods is what determines what foods are alkaline-forming and what foods are acid-forming. For example lemons are acidic in nature, but have an alkalizing effect on the body once they are digested. Similarly, milk is alkaline outside the body, but acidic upon digestion. Scientists can tell how foods will react inside the body by incinerating the food and analyzing the mineral content of its ash. If the mineral content is highly alkaline, then the food will likely have an alkalizing effect on the body, and vice versa. The type of soil used to grow fruits and vegetables can influence their mineral content and test results can vary.To maintain health, the diet should consist of 60% alkaline forming foods and 40% acid forming foods. To restore health, the diet should consist of 80% alkaline forming foods and 20% acid forming foods. Generally, alkaline forming foods include: most fruits, green vegetables, peas, beans, lentils, spices, herbs and seasonings, and seeds and nuts. Generally, acid forming foods include: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, grains, and legumes. Shifting Your pH Toward Alkaline... This chart is for those trying to adjust their body pH. The pH scale is from 0 to 14, with numbers below 7 acidic (low on oxygen) and numbers above 7 alkaline. An acidic body is a sickness magnet
how long should you let paint dry between coats	Spray a test panel with base coat and clear coat first to compare color match and coverage. Apply as many medium coats necessary to cover the area waiting 5-10 minutes between each coat. Each coat should appear uniform and dry between each coat. You may gently use a tack cloth between each dry coat of basecoat. Spray light dust coats if a metallic or pearl color looks too dark. Wait 30 minutes before using clear coat. Tri-coat paints are different. You spray the groundcoat color first, one coat at a time until the area is covered. Then you use the midcoat pearl color.A – Brushes are a personal preference, but if you are looking for a smoother finish a synthetic brush is best and if you would like more texture, use a natural bristle brush. With the wax, a wax brush is always best as long as it is a lightweight one. Heavy wax brushes tend to over apply the product and ‘scrub’ too hard. Q – Can I use other sealers like polyurethane on this paint? A – Yes you can. Q – How long does it take to dry? How long should I wait before waxing after painting? A – It depends on the weather, but mostly the paint will dry within 2 hours, but sometimes much quicker. Actually, APC paint makes “watching paint dry” fast and fun! Q – How do I know which finish to use? How many coats will it need? A – It depends on what you are doing and the look you would like to achieve. Top Coat (3 coats for maximum protection) will give you a finish that is washable with a slightly damp rag and wax is more of a fine furniture finish.

what makes the earths mantle flow	Mantle convection is the slow motion of the Earth's silicate  mantle, caused by convection currents that carry heat from the  interior to the surface of the Earth. Mantle co … nvection causes the  tectonic plates to move around the Earth's surface, causing  earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic activity.he heat of the mantle and the movement around under earth makes  the plates move. It's kind of like giant floating rafts on an  ocean. The water beneath them would cause th … em to move, and perhaps  to run into each other, or even tear one apart or sink it if it got  into the wrong spot.The crust and the upper layer of the mantle together make up a zone of rigid, brittle rock called the Lithosphere. The layer below the rigid lithosphere is a zone of asphalt-like consistancy called the Asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is the part of the mantle that flows and moves the plates of the Earth.The Mantle. The mantle is the layer located directly under the sima. It is the largest layer of the Earth, 1800 miles thick.The mantle is composed of very hot, dense rock. This layer of rock even flows like asphalt under a heavy weight. This flow is due to great temperature differences from the bottom to the top of the mantle.he mantle is much hotter and has the ability to flow. The Outer and Inner Cores are hotter still with pressures so great that you would be squeezed into a ball smaller than a marble if you were able to go to the center of the Earth!!!!!! The Crust. The Earth's Crust is like the skin of an apple.
what happens when you stop breathing	Best Answer: It depends on how you stop breathing. If you stop breathing naturally i.e. diaphragm stops functioning, you die peacefully like many elderly people.If you stop breathing because of an air-passage block, you will instinctively move to open your air-passage and wake up.There is a medical condition called sleep apnea, where the victim accidentally closes their airway by tilting their head at an odd angle.est Answer: It depends on how you stop breathing. If you stop breathing naturally i.e. diaphragm stops functioning, you die peacefully like many elderly people.What Happens. Obstructive sleep apnea causes your airway to narrow or close off, reducing or stopping breathing for short periods during sleep. If your breathing stops, you may make grunting, gasping, or snorting sounds and restless body movements. As breathing resumes, loud snoring starts.This may happen many times during a night. The more often it happens, the more severe your sleep apnea is. Sleep apnea is called either mild, moderate, or severe. When you stop breathing, the oxygen levels in your blood go down and carbon dioxide levels go up.This makes your heart and blood vessels work harder and can affect your heart rate and nervous system.hat Happens.

what is bovine gelatin kosher	Star-K said, Kosher gelatin is derived from kosher animal sources. Gelatin derived from pig would not be considered kosher. Kosher gelatin is derived from kosher slaughtered and processed bovine sources or from kosher species of fish. Gelatin derived from fish is permitted in yogurt or other dairy foods according to most opinions.. Star-K also told us their position on the use of gelatin (a meat product) in yogurt (a dairy product). In e-mail correspondence, Miriam Wudowsky of the OK kosher certifying agency said, Kosher gelatin is made from kosher fish and/or agar agar. The OK never uses anything made from pig or other nonkosher animals.. The OU does certify as kosher the bovine gelatin derived from cattle slaughtered in kosher fashion. To the best of our knowledge, there are two companies that produce gelatin certifiable according to OU standards. One of them is Glatech Productions, a New Jersey-based company that produces Kolatin® brand kosher gelatinBefore writing about kosher gelatin, let's explain what gelatin is. Gelatin is a colorless and tasteless substance that comes from collagen inside the skin and bones of animals. It is commonly used to give food a gelatinous texture and in pharmaceuticals. Gelatin Alternatives. Some alternatives to gelatin that are not from animal or fish sources are agar-agar, which is a seaweed, pectin, guar gum and others. Since these alternatives are plant based, they are generally kosher, though production and potential additives make certification essential.

formula for variable cost ratio	Variable cost ratio = total variable cost / sales. As long as price and variable cost remain the same, these ratios will remain the same. It does not matter if the company sells 10 units or 1 million units, the percentage of each sale that becomes contribution margin or does to cover variable costs is the same. Hangout Limited, LLC sells one product priced at $40 per unit. The variable costs (direct materials, direct labor, variable overhead and variable selling) is $25 per unit. Calculate the contribution margin per unit, the contribution margin ratio and the variable cost ratio. We know that contribution margin is price less variable cost. Therefore, contribution margin is: $40 – $25 = $15. That means that for every unit we sell, $15 will go to cover fixed cost and profitThe variable cost ratio is variable cost per unit / price. $25 / $40 = 62.5%. This tells us that for every unit sold, 62.5% will go to cover variable costs. These ratios are important as we start to look at planning and decision making using contribution margin. Hangout Limited, LLC sells one product priced at $40 per unit. The variable costs (direct materials, direct labor, variable overhead and variable selling) is $25 per unit.

tinea pedis is commonly called	T rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum most commonly cause tinea pedis, with T rubrum being the most common cause worldwide. Trichophyton tonsurans has also been implicated in children. Nondermatophyte causes include Scytalidium dimidiatum, Scytalidium hyalinum, and, rarely, Candida species. The first report of tinea pedis was in 1908 by Whitfield, who, with Sabouraud, believed that tinea pedis was a very rare infection caused by the same organisms that produce tinea capitis. Tinea pedis is the term used for a dermatophyte infection of the soles of the feet and the interdigital spaces. Tinea pedis is most commonly caused by Trichophyton rubrum, a dermatophyte initially endemic only to a small region of Southeast Asia and in parts of Africa and Australia. Interestingly, tinea pedis was not noted in these areas then, possibly because these populations did not wear occlusive footwearRingworm is a common infection of the skin and nails that is caused by fungus. The infection is called “ringworm” because it can cause an itchy, red, circular rash. Ringworm is also called “tinea” or “dermatophytosis.” The different types of ringworm are usually named for the location of the infection on the body. Areas of the body that can be affected by ringworm include: 1  Feet (tinea pedis, commonly called “athlete’s foot”). 2  Groin, inner thighs, or buttocks (tinea cruris, commonly called “jock itch”). 3  Scalp (tinea capitis). 4  Beard (tinea barbae). 5  Hands (tinea manuum). 
what diseases do cat bites mean	Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is a bacterial infection spread by cats. The disease spreads when an infected cat licks a person's open wound, or bites or scratches a person hard enough to break the surface of the skin. About three to 14 days after the skin is broken, a mild infection can occur at the site of the scratch or bite. A person with CSD may also have a fever, headache, poor appetite, and exhaustion. Later, the person's lymph nodes closest to the original scratch or bite can become swollen, tender, or painful. Wash cat bites and scratches well with soap and running water. Do not allow cats to lick your wounds. Contact your doctor if you develop any symptoms of cat-scratch disease or infection. CSD is caused by a bacterium called Bartonella henselae. About 40% of cats carry B. henselae at some time in their lives, although most cats with this infection show NO signs of illnessDiseases from cats. Animal bites: Cats. Dog and cat bites account for $30 million in annual health care costs nationwide and 1% of ER visits. Cat bites have a higher rate of infection than dog bites. Puncture wounds, hand wounds, and wounds that are greater than 24 hours old are at higher risk for infection. It is usually caused by the bite of a flea that has fed on an infected wild animal, such as a rat, chipmunk or prairie dog. It usually causes large sores and abscesses in the glands of the arms and legs. Dogs, and especially cats, can also become infected and can spread the disease to their human companions.

what is deep groundwater	Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth 's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The upper level of this saturated layer of an unconfined aquifer is called the water table or phreatic surface. Below the water table, where in general all pore spaces are saturated with water, is the phreatic zone. Substrate with low porosity that permits limited transmission of groundwater is known as an aquitard.In Illinois, groundwater is developed from three principal aquifer types: - Deep bedrock aquifers lying at depths of 500 feet or greater below the land surface; and-Sand and gravel aquifers and shallow bedrock aquifers lying within 500 feet of land surface. Groundwater exists in the tiny spaces between sub-surface soil, sand and rock. If the ground is permeable (that is, if fluids like water are able to move through it), it will become saturated with water when it rains or water seeps in from lakes and rivers.
cost to install a concrete block retaining wall	Retaining Wall Cost. Poured retaining walls with elaborate curves require complex formwork and will drive up cost for a wall. The total cost to have a concrete retaining wall installed will be a combination of material and labor prices. For a basic wall you can expect to pay between $30 and $40 per square foot. If you add a decorative finish, curves, steps, lighting or other upgrades, the cost will rise. For Ralston, $39 per square foot is the average cost he charges for a wall under 4 feet tall. For walls below 4 feet, he says his prices are often competitive with finished block. A block wall has to be stuccoed or finished with veneer, while a concrete wall does not need an added finish.Concrete Retaining Wall Prices. Concrete retaining wall prices start around $30 per square foot including materials and installation and can go as high as $45 to $50 per square foot depending on how much prep work is involved in building the forms. Walls higher than four feet typically require a different type of form which will raise the cost. Wood Retaining Wall Prices. Wooden retaining walls start at around $20 per square foot including materials and installation if using cost-effective pressure treated lumber. Hardwoods such as redwood, Cyprus or mahogany will raise the price over $30 per surface square foot but add an element of beauty to your wall. Railroad ties are the most commonly used wood for a retaining wall, and prices for this type of wall cost between $25 and $30 per square foot of wall

what are some causes of child obesity quizlet growth and development	by Children’s HealthWatch (formerly the Children’s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program (C-SNAP)), and by many other researchers, on the impacts of food insecurity and hunger on children’s health, growth and development. A large body of research literature, amassed over the past two decades, shows clearly that food insecurity and hunger together with other correlates of poverty, can dramatically alter the architecture of children’s brains, making it impossible for them to fulfill their potential. OBJECTIVES OF THE REPORT In this report we present the results of Children’s HealthWatch’s recent research on the associations of food insecurity and hunger, as measured by the US Food Security Scale, with child health, growth and development.What Causes Obesity in Children? Children become overweight and obese for a variety of reasons. The most common causes are genetic factors, lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, or a combination of these factors. Only in rare cases is being overweight caused by a medical condition such as a hormonal problem. A physical exam and some blood tests can rule out the possibility of a medical condition as the cause for obesity. Although weight problems run in families, not all children with a family history of obesity will be overweight. Children whose parents or brothers or sisters are overweight may be at an increased risk of becoming overweight themselves, but this can be linked to shared family behaviors such as eating and activity habits.
dog food without rice to prevent rashes	Now, however, many dogs are showing allergies to lamb and rice diets. This is to be expected since an allergy can develop to any diet. If your dog is allergic to lamb and rice you may need to find a food with different ingredients such as fish and oatmeal, or venison and sweet potato. While your dog is on any special diet, it’s very important that she doesn’t get any other food such as cookies, treats, rawhides, people foods, etc. For example, if you use a food with five protein sources (i.e., turkey, chicken, duck, salmon, and tuna) and your dog develops an allergy to it, you now have to find a food that doesn’t contain any of these protein sources. This can be challenging. Conversely, if you feed a diet with chicken as its sole protein source and your dog develops an allergy to it, you can easily find a diet that doesn’t contain chicken. Preventing food allergies may be impossible in dogs that are prone to developing food allergiesSometimes, food allergies will lead to an itchy spot around your dog’s anus. 1  Other skin problems, such as skin infections or hyperpigmentation, could develop as a result of your dog licking and/or biting at the itchy spots. 2  Chronic ear infections and digestive upset are common signs of food allergies. Foods that commonly trigger allergies in dogs include beef, chicken, wheat, and dairy. 1  The immune response always has a genetic basis, but it has also been suggested that receiving antibiotics early in life could make a dog more prone to developing

antipsychotic medications are also called	2400. Newer antipsychotics: over the last 10 years, newer medications have appeared. They still block dopamine, but much less so than the older drugs. They also work on different chemical messengers in the brain (such as serotonin) and are often called ‘atypical’ or ‘second-generation’ antipsychotics. This is misleading-they have many of the same effects as the older drugs. The newer antipsychotics are also being used to help treat some people's depression. These older drugs are often called ‘typical’ or 'first-generation' antipsychotics. They all block the action of dopamine (see above), some more strongly than others. Side-effects include: 1  stiffness and shakiness, like Parkinson’s disease. 2  feeling sluggish and slow in your thinking. 3  uncomfortable restlessness (akathisia).Antipsychotic Medications. Antipsychotic medications are the main form of treatment for psychotic disorders, not just for the treatment of schizophrenia. They are also called neuroleptic drugs or neuroleptics. Antipsychotic medications first came into recognition in the 1950s when it was fortuatously first used as an anxiolytic for the treatment of delirium. It was noticed that it had a very calming effect and that psychotic symptoms also improved. In scientific terms, they are called antogonists-they antagonise the action of dopamine. Drugs which attach to receptors and promote the action of the receptor are called agonists. Drugs can also be judged by the degree of potency of the action at the receptor.
What is the definition of a terrorism act designed to do	It's ironic -- the word terrorism appears constantly in newscasts, congressional debates and speeches by world leaders, often as a way of securing public support for one security measure or another. But for such a widely used word, there's actually no single definition of what terrorism means. There are many, and often, they're incompatible. Not only is the public confused about what to call terrorism -- the U.S. government is as conflicted as anyone. Hoffman, for what it’s worth, concluded in his book that that terrorism is the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change.. Hoffman’s logic was that all terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence.In this Act terrorism means the use of violence for political ends, and includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear. The Terrorism Act 2000 (c.11) is the first of a number of general Terrorism Acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It superseded and repealed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996. Section 41 of the Act provided the police with the power to arrest and detain a person without charge for up to 48 hours if they were suspected of being a terrorist. This period of detention could be extended to up to seven days if the police can persuade a judge that it is necessary for further questioning.
average video game cost to make	Wii games require about $5-10 million in the average case, including marketing costs. He asserts PS3 and X360 games need much more resources, from $20 million up to a staggering $50 million with sales of 1.3 to 1.5 million units to make money on them. Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has predicted game budgets will rise to an average of USD 60 million in the future. Games for Xbox 360 and PS3 cost between USD 20 million and USD 30 million to make. In 2002, as game software and hardware become more elaborate and the profit potential grows, the development budgets of hit software titles are swelling as well. It took between $5 to $10 million to develop a PS2 game versus $800,000 to $1.7 million for the original PlayStation. Namco Bandai Holdings President Takeo Takasu said rising development costs for next-generation games mean companies need to sell at least 500,000 copies in order to make a profit.Four years ago, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot estimated that the average production budget for the generation of games following Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 would be $60 million. In an 2012 investor report, Take-Two admitted some of its top titles cost in excess of $60 million for development alone. E.T. - $23 million (licensing) - In Master of the Game a 1994 biography about the late Steve Ross, then-CEO of Atari's then-parent company Warner Communications Skip Paul, an Atari executive at the time, told author Connie Bruck the company spent $23 million to secure the license for the infamous bomb.
what do tendons and ligaments consist of	Understanding Spinal Anatomy: Ligaments, Tendons and Muscles. Ligaments and tendons are fibrous bands of connective tissue that attach to bone. Ligaments connect two or more bones together and help stabilize joints. Tendons attach muscle to bone. Tendons vary in size and are somewhat elastic and attach bones to muscles. Tendons and Muscles. Tendons are similar to ligaments, except these tension-withstanding fibrous tissues attach muscle to bone. Tendons consist of densely packed collagen fibers. Muscles, either individually or in groups, are supported by fascia. Fascia is strong sheath-like connective tissueDifference Between Tendon and Ligament. Tendons and ligaments are the two major connective tissues besides fascia, a layer of fibrous tissue. Both of them are important parts of the “human musculoskeletal system”, also referred to as the locomotor system. They play vital roles in the functioning of the joints and bones. The first and major difference between tendons and ligaments is that tendons connect skeletal muscles to bones, while ligaments connect two different bones together. Tendons consist of parallel bundles of collagen fibers, whereas ligaments mainly consist of elastic fibers. Tendons are composed of elastin, collagen fibers, manganese, copper, calcium, and proteoglycans. Ligaments on the other hand, consist of a bunch of small packets of yielding collagen fibers. Ligament cells lie between the skeletal (bone) joints, in the region of uterus and the abdominal cavity
what is the meaning of lux et veritas	Veritas is also the name given to the Roman virtue of truthfulness, which was considered one of the main virtues any good Roman should possess.

what type of bond is between nitrogenous bases and why	Overview [edit]. A DNA nucleotide is composed of 3 main units: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. While the sugar and phosphate group alternate in sequence and form the backbone of the DNA double helix, the nitrogenous bases may differ in every adjoining nucleotide. The four nitrogenous bases present in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). In RNA, the only differing nitrogenous base is uracil (U) (which replaces thymine in DNA and differs thymine only by the missing methyl group at carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring). Of the nitrogenous bases, adenine and guanine are purines, which are aromatic compounds attached to an imidazole group, while cytosine and thymine and uracil compose a set of pyrimidines, which are one ring-aromatic compounds.These nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the twisted ladder or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides. Adenine is always paired with thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine. These are known as base pairs. The main biological function of a nitrogenous base is to bond nucleic acids together. A nitrogenous, or nitrogen-containing, base is an organic molecule with a nitrogen atom that has the chemical properties of a base. A nitrogenous base owes its basic properties to the lone pair of electrons of a nitrogen atom.

how practical is a tesla	Tesla built his first oscillator as a tool for studying high-frequency electrical phenomena. He also constructed high-frequency electrical alternators for the same purpose. When it comes to describing practical applications for this type of electrical power supply, top on my list is high-frequency electric lighting. Tesla's investigations in the area of high-voltage RF power processing techniques resulted in the very first high-efficiency, high-frequency lighting ballasts. He experimented with both fluorescent-and incandescent-type lamps, as well as high-frequency arc lighting. See Wireless Remote Control and the Electronic Computer Logic Gate for an exhibit in the U.S. patent interference Nikola Tesla vs. Reginald A. Fessenden, Interference No. 21,701, Systems of Signaling showing a circuit diagram of an electronic AND logic gate used by Tesla in 1899.Ten years ago, Tesla set out to prove that the future of cars was electric. For its first trick, it built the Roadster, a sleek and blazingly fast sports car that showed electric cars could be high-performance cars. With only two seats and a base price of $109,000, the Roadster was never meant to be a big seller. Of course, if you’re trading in a gas-guzzler for either car, you’ll be doing a lot of good for the environment. But rather than proving that the era of the electric car is at hand, the Model S shows just how much work remains to be done.

what does a radiologist do	Radiological exams are absolute necessities in the medical evaluation of any patient and the radiologist is the one that interprets these after ensuring the are made to the highest levels of quality and standards. All radiologists are well trained in the expert use of the various radiological modalities and equipment. These include MRI (magnetic Resonance Imaging), ultrasound (Diagnostic sonography), interventional radiology, fluoroscopy, digital radiography, angiography, nuclear medicine, mammography, and computed tomography. The radiologist is also trained in nuclear medicine and uses that to look into pulmonary embolism, heart disease, signs of stroke, obstructed gall bladder, spread of cancer, bone density, and kidney function among many others.Generally, a radiologist: A radiologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and injury by using medical imaging technologies, such as MRI and CT. Radiologists also treat diseases, such as cancer or heart disease, by means of radiation or minimally invasive, image-guided surgery.

A radiologist who is certified by the American Board of Radiology will clearly meet this recommendation (all Inland Imaging radiologists are board certified). In its practice guidelines, the ACR defines alternative pathways for physician qualification.
what is mosquito coil	To use a mosquito coil, you first place it in a holder to keep it safe and off the ground where it can get air to burn. Simple holders are often included with the coils, but some people get quite particular about what they use to contain their coils, with pig-shaped ceramic holders being a perennial favorite. I vaguely remember seeing the occasional mosquito coil when I was growing up in the United States but most people used bug spray and citronella candles. Mosquito coils were actually invented in Japan, at the end of the 19th century. A man named Ueyama Eiichiro was in the business of exporting mandarin oranges when Fukuzawa Yukichi, the famous author, statesman and founder of Keio University, introduced him to a seed trader in the United StatesA mosquito coil is a mosquito repelling incense, usually shaped into a spiral, and typically made from a dried paste of pyrethrum powder. The coil is usually held at the center of the spiral, suspending it in the air, or wedged by two pieces of fireproof nettings to allow continuous smoldering. Burning usually begins at the outer end of the spiral and progresses slowly toward the centre of the spiral, producing a mosquito-repellent smoke. Active ingredients found in mosquito coils may include: 1  Pyrethrum-a natural, powdered material from a kind of chrysanthemum plant; performance moderate. 2  Pyrethrins-an extract of the insecticidal chemicals in pyrethrum. 3  Allethrin-sometimes d-trans-allethrin, the first synthetic pyrethroid.
what role does the white house staff play	The White House Chief of Staff is the highest ranking employee of the White House. The position is a modern successor to the earlier role of the President's private secretary. The role was formalized as the Assistant to the President in 1946 and acquired its current name in 1961. The Chief of Staff is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the President; it does not require Senate confirmation. The current White House Chief of Staff is Denis McDonough. He assumed the position on January 25, 2013, after the previous Chief of Staff, Jack Lew, was nominated to become Secretary of the Treasury. The average term of service for a White House Chief of Staff is a little under 2.5 years. John R. Steelman, under Harry S. Truman, was the last Chief of Staff to serve for an entire presidential administration. Steelman also holds the record for longest-serving Chief of Staff (six years).The White House Office is an entity within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The White House Office is headed by the White House Chief of Staff, who is also the head of the Executive Office. The staff of the various offices are based in the West Wing and East Wing of the White House, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and the New Executive Office Building. The White House Office is organized in accordance with the wishes of each incumbent President and is directed by staff chosen by the President. A staff authorization was initially established in 1978 (92 Stat. 2445).
what produces visible light	Our eyes are sensitive to light which lies in a very small region of the electromagnetic spectrum labeled visible light. This visible light corresponds to a wavelength range of 400 - 700 nanometers (nm) and a color range of violet through red. The human eye is not capable of seeing radiation with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. The visible colors from shortest to longest wavelength are: violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. Ultraviolet radiation has a shorter wavelength than the visible violet light. The visible blue light has a wavelength of about 475 nm. Because the blue wavelengths are shorter in the visible spectrum, they are scattered more efficiently by the molecules in the atmosphere. This causes the sky to appear blue.White light is dispersed by a prism into the colors of the visible spectrum. The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430–770 THz. Visible wavelengths pass through the  optical window , the region of the electromagnetic spectrum that allows wavelengths to pass largely unattenuated through the Earth's atmosphere. An example of this phenomenon is that clean air scatters blue light more than red wavelengths, and so the midday sky appears blue.
how to cook salmon on a plank on weber grill	1 Place the plank on the grill rack and allow it to preheat for about 5 minutes, or until it begins to crackle and smoke. 2  Lay the salmon onto the plank, cover the grill, and allow the salmon to cook for 18 to 22 minutes, depending on its thickness. 3  To test for doneness, insert a fork into the thickest part of the salmon.

flu and cold contagious period	However, the viruses that cause colds (for example, rhinoviruses) are not the same as those that cause the flu (influenza viruses). Although the typical incubation period for influenza is about one to four days, some adults can be contagious from about one day before onset of symptoms for up to two weeks. Other people who develop complications, such as pneumonia, may extend the contagious period for a week or two. For colds, most individuals become contagious about a day before cold symptoms develop and remain contagious for about five to seven daysMost experts agree that adults with a cold or the flu start being contagious about a day before they start experiencing symptoms. For the flu, the contagious period then lasts five to seven days into the illness. For children, the contagious period for the flu can last up to two weeks after they start feeling sick, even if they start feeling better before that. The contagious period for a cold lasts about three to four days into the illness. As a general rule, people with a cold are most contagious about three days after their initial exposure to the virus. For more information on colds, influenza and related topics, check out the links on the next page. Print. If you think about how a virus works, it makes sense that we're most contagious when our symptoms are at their worst. Viruses like influenza and those that cause the common cold (there are a couple of hundred of them) have an incubation period once they get into your body.

which is more toxic selenium or arsenic	icity and transport properties of arsenic strongly depend on their chemical form. The forms of arsenic occur with valance states of −3, 0, 3, and 5. Most arsenic exists as arsenite (AsO3 3, As(III)) and arsenate (AsO3 4, As(V)) in water [3], and As(III) is more toxic than As(V). Meanwhile, selenium is a natural trace element, known to be an essential nutrient for animals and humans. Selenium contamination in drinking water is currently of concern because of the narrow range between selenium deﬁciency and toxicity to humans [4,5]. Selenium is introduced into water from various sources including agricultural activities, fossil fuel combustion, and other industrial efﬂuents [6]. Selenium exists in valance state of −2, 0, 4, and 6 and has several organic forms [7]. Because higher valance forms of selenium are more water soluble, selenite (SeO2 3, Se(IV)) and selenate (SeO 2 4, Se(VI)) are the predominant forms found in water, and Se(IV) is more toxic than Se(VI) [5,8]. The United States Environmen-tal Protection Agency has established the maximumSelenium (IV) is more toxic due to its higher bioavailability.34 Selenium is known to be carcinogenic at higher concentrations,33 but at much lower levels has anti-carcinogenic properties which prevent arsenic toxic effects.35,36,37 Less is known about its speciation, distribution and transformation in groundwater.38,39 Selenium levels in groundwater are usually very low, although levels can be significant in areas of pollution.39,40
why is lincoln a great leader	Abraham Lincoln is more than America’s 16th president. He’s a model of leadership who demonstrates traits and characteristics that are essential for present day executives and business leaders. Like Lincoln, you face the challenge of executing a vision, while also managing competing priorities. I recently saw the film Lincoln, which reminded me of the powerful, long-lasting legacy of leadership principles Abraham Lincoln left behind. If you haven’t had an opportunity to see the movie, I highly recommend it. Lincoln is a leader who embodies the attributes of leadership absent in many corporations today.His commitment to the rights of individuals was a cornerstone of his leadership style (Phillips, 1992). There have been many great leaders throughout the history of this great nation, but Abraham Lincoln is consistently mentioned as one of our greatest leaders. Although Lincoln possessed many characteristics of a great leader, probably his greatest leadership trait was his ability to communicate. Though Lincoln only had one year of formal education, he was able to master language and use his words to influence the people as a great public speaker, debater and as a humorist. Another part of Lincoln’s skills as a great communicator, was that he had a great capacity for learning to listen to different points of view. While president, he created a work environment where his cabinet members were able to disagree with his decisions without the threat of retaliation for doing so.
what are some functions of lipids in the body	Many different types of molecules in the body, such as fats, waxes, and fat-soluble vitamins, fall into the category of lipids.. Energy storage is the most common of the many functions of lipids, though they can also provide cellular structure or act as signaling molecules. Other important but less common functions of lipids in the body include enzyme activation, molecular transportation, and metabolism. Humans must consume lipids as a part of their diets because of the nutrients they contain and because some fats are required in order to store fat-soluble vitamins. Energy storage and cell membrane formation are the two most prominent functions of lipids in the body, but there are other functions. It is believed that lipids play an important role in cellular signaling, the process by which various biochemical processes are initiated or stoppedFunctions of Lipids. A lipid is a non-soluble molecular organic compound comprised of hydrogen and carbon. As far as their purpose in the human body goes, lipids are of crucial importance for both energy storage and cell membrane development. Plants and animals alike contain lipids which they depend on for energy. Gram for gram, a lipid contains more than twice the amount of energy found in carbohydrates. 6. Along with a chain of alcohols, fatty acids are found in waxes. These are extremely common lipids and can be found on animal feathers, in human ears and even on the leaves of plants. Their primary function is one of protection.
what is a carbon atom	The six electrons can't all go around the nucleus at the same distance-only two electrons can fit in the inner shell. So some of the electrons have to go farther away from the nucleus. A carbon atom has two shells, with two electrons in the inner shell and four electrons in the outer shell. But that outer shell could hold as many as eight electrons-it's not full. Most of what we use for fuel is made of carbon, too. Coal, gasoline, oil, and wood are all made of hydro-carbons. In the picture you can see leftover carbon dust pouring out of this truck that burns diesel fuel. It's this carbon pouring into the air that's causing global warming.A carbon–carbon bond is a covalent bond between two carbon atoms. The most common form is the single bond: a bond composed of two electrons, one from each of the two atoms. The carbon–carbon single bond is a sigma bond and is formed between one hybridized orbital from each of the carbon atoms. In ethane, the orbitals are sp 3 hybridized orbitals, but single bonds formed between carbon atoms with other hybridisations do occur (e.g. sp 2 to sp 2). In fact, the carbon atoms in the single bond need not be of the same hybridisation. Carbon atoms can also form double bonds in compounds called alkenes or triple bonds in compounds called alkynes. A double bond is formed with an sp 2 hybridized orbital and a p-orbital that isn't involved in the hybridization. A triple bond is formed with an sp hybridized orbital and two p-orbitals from each atom
cost for a solar panel	When people ask the question, “How much will solar panels cost,” they could really be asking either, “How much does a solar panel cost,” or “How much will it cost for enough solar panels to power my house?”. The first question is more directly related to solar panel cost, so we’ll cover that first. The answer is a little tricky because it depends on whether you are planning to buy pre-made solar panels or make them yourself. For premade solar panels, a single panel can cost about $900, or $12 per watt. A medium sized system to provide power to a small or very energy efficient house might cost $25,000 and a solar system to power a large house could cost $50,000+. It will be – initial solar panel cost is the biggest drawback to solar power. Tax breaks can help a lot – you can save up to half the cost with credits, rebates and incentives. You can also save a lot of money by building your own solar panels. You can build a solar panel yourself for as little as $200.This metric indicates costs relative to electrical power output. The cost of solar panels have decreased significantly over the last decade and are currently selling for under $0.70/W in industrial quantities. For homeowners, this translates to about $1.5/W. We decided to pull together all aspects of this question, and write the best resource on the costs of solar panels you will find on the entire Internet. Residential solar systems are typically sized from 3 to 8kW and end up costing between $15,000 and $40,000.
symptoms of food and pollen-food allergy syndrome	In many people who have hay fever, fresh fruits and vegetables and certain nuts and spices can trigger an allergic reaction that causes the mouth to tingle or itch. In some people, pollen-food allergy syndrome — sometimes called oral allergy syndrome — can cause swelling of the throat or even anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis. In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, including: 1  Constriction and tightening of airways. 2  A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe.Some individuals with pollen allergies (allergic rhinitis or hay fever) can develop symptoms around and in the mouth and throat immediately after eating raw fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts or seeds that contain proteins cross-reactive to the pollens. This is known as oral allergy syndrome or pollen-food syndrome. For example, people with birch pollen allergy may experience symptoms after eating raw apples, peaches, pitted fruits, carrot, peanut and hazelnut among others. Likewise, ragweed allergic individuals experience symptoms with melons among other foods. This is an IgE-mediated food allergy. When exposure to the food occurs, symptoms start quickly. Symptoms include any or several of the following: skin itching, hives, swelling of the skin, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing difficulty (wheezing, repeated throat clearing, cough, throat tightness), or anaphylaxis.

what are the vegetation zones of mali	The four main rivers of Mali are the Niger, Bafing, Bakaye and the Senegal. Vegetation in Mali is not very plenty. As it is a part of Sahara desert, shrubs and short grasses are common in the region. Most of the people of Mali dwell along the bank of the river Niger. The Niger River in the Fouta Djallon region is the main source of water for Mali. Water from the Niger River is used for drinking purpose, irrigation and industrial use.Mali is a landlocked nation in West Africa, located southwest of Algeria, extending south-west from the southern Sahara Desert through the Sahel to the Sudanian savanna zone. Mali's size is 1,240,192 square kilometres. Desert or semi-desert covers about 65 percent of Mali's area. The Niger River creates a large and fertile inland delta as it arcs northeast through Mali from Guinea before turning south and eventually emptying into the Gulf of Guinea. The Niger (with 1,693 kilometers in Mali) and Senegal are Mali’s two largest rivers. The Niger is generally described as Mali’s lifeblood, a source of food, drinking water, irrigation, and transportation. The country's lowest point is on the Senegal River (23 m) and its highest point is Hombori Tondo (1155 m). Mali's territory encompasses three natural zones: the southern cultivated Sudanese zone, central semi-desert Sahelian zone, and northern desert Saharan zone. The terrain is primarily savanna in the south and flat to rolling plains or high plateau (200–500 meters in elevation) in the north.
how long for peas to germinate	How to Germinate Peas. Peas supply a wide variety of nutrients to your diet. Depending on the type--from sugar snap peas to dry peas to green garden peas-they provide high amounts of fiber, iron, protein, Vitamin C, lysine, tryptophan and carbohydrates. Peas are a cool-season crop, so indoor planting and germination should take place several weeks before the last frost in your area. This will ensure plenty of time for outdoor planting, growth and harvest before temperatures warm to the point where pea plants fail to grow and produce. Although you can plant pea seeds directly in the ground, horticulturists with the Oregon State University Extension Service and the University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources advise that knowledge of how to germinate peas before planting ensures a better harvest.Temperature. Peas will sprout in 21 to 30 days if the soil temperature is 38 degrees Fahrenheit and the germination rate, or number of seeds that do sprout, will be low. At temperatures of 65 to 70 F the seeds will sprout within 7 to 14 days and the germination percentage will be in the high 90s for fresh seed. Above 75 F the germination percentage goes down quickly even though the seeds sprout quickly. Remember, these are soil temperatures, not air temperatures. Peas are a cool weather crop, but the seeds take a long time to germinate in cold soil. The length of time it takes for a pea seed to germinate depends on temperature, moisture and age of the seed.
what does such ag mean	Sic in square brackets is an editing term used with quotations or excerpts. It means “that’s really how it appears in the original.”. It is used to point out a grammatical error, misspelling, misstatement of fact, or, as above, the unconventional spelling of a name. (remembering Ockham’s Razor). Sic is a Latin word meaning “thus”, “so”, “as such”, or “in such a manner”. It is used when writing quoted material to indicate that an incorrect or unusual spelling, phrase, punctuation or meaning in the quote has been reproduced verbatim from the original and is not a transcription error.GmbH companies are incorporated and, as such, are legal entities unto themselves. These companies must have a minimum of two partners and may be, but do not have to be, owned by a public company. German companies that are publicly traded are designated as such by the letters 'AG' after the company name. 'AG' is an abbreviation for the German word Aktiengesellschaft, which literally translates to 'corporation' in English. The laws of a country determine which types of companies are legally recognized within the country's borders. By Investopedia Staff AAA |. A: In Germany, there are two types of companies: publicly traded and privately held. The acronym 'GmbH', which is written after the name of the company, designates a company as private in Germany. The letters stand for Gesellschaft mit beschraenkter Beschränkter haftung, which translated, literally means 'a company with limited'. liability
how wide should a shared driveway be	Compare circular, curved, and straight driveway layouts. See also: walkway width. Single car driveways can be as narrow as 9 feet, or as wide as 12 feet. A 9 foot driveway is quite tight and may have difficulty accommodating larger vehicles such as delivery or trash trucks. Additionally, 9 feet may mean that guests are stepping in grass or dirt as they exit their vehicles. However, anything wider than 12 feet, but less than 20, is a waste because it is too wide for one car, but not large enough for two. Double car driveways can be between 20 and 24 feet wide. The standard driveway width for residential homes ranges from 9 feet to 24 feet. The width of your driveway will vary based on whether you want a single car drive or double car drive. Additionally, the width may change to accommodate parking or a turn-around, these added features will change the cost of your driveway.When it comes to parking pads: We figure on 10 feet width per car. And 20 feet in length per car. If you desire for your cars to be parked side by side, a double wide parking pad measuring 20 feet wide is appropriate. However, paying attention to the length of the driveway or parking area is important too. 10-12 Feet In Width Is Normal. If you are starting from scratch such as with nothing or a stone base we would go with 10 -12 feet wide. If you have a mid-size car to pickup truck a 10 foot wide driveway would be the norm. For campers, trailers or bigger pickup trucks we would go to 12 feet in width
what will be my retirement age?	Click on your year of birth to find out how much your benefit will be reduced if you retire between age 62 and full retirement age. Note: If your birthday is on January 1st, we figure your benefit as if your birthday was in the previous year. If You Retire Early. You can retire at any time between age 62 and full retirement age. However, if you start benefits early, your benefits are reduced a fraction of a percent for each month before your full retirement age. The chart below lists age 62 reduction amounts and includes examples based on an estimated monthly benefit of $1000 at full retirement ageIf your full retirement age is older than 65 (that is, you were born after 1937), you still will be able to take your benefits at age 62, but the reduction in your benefit amount will be greater than it is for people who were born before 1938. Here's how it works if your full retirement age is 67. If you start your retirement benefits at age 62, your monthly benefit amount is reduced by about 30 percent. The reduction for starting benefits at age. 1  63 is about 25 percent; 2  64 is about 20 percent; 3  65 is about 13.3 percent; and. 4  66 is about 6.7 percent. The earliest you can start receiving Social Security retirement benefits will remain age 62. Note: If you delay your retirement benefits until after full retirement age, you also may be eligible for delayed retirement credits that would increase your monthly benefit. If you decide to delay your retirement, be sure to.
igneous granite types geology	Granite is a light-colored igneous rock with grains large enough to be visible with the unaided eye. It forms from the slow crystallization of magma below Earth’s surface. Granite is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor amounts of mica, amphiboles and other minerals. This mineral composition usually gives granite a red, pink, gray or white color with dark mineral grains visible throughout the rock. Granite is the best-known igneous rock. This chart illustrates the generalized mineral composition of igneous rocks. Granites and rhyolites (compositionally equivalent to granite but of a fine grain size) are composed mainly of orthoclase feldspar, quartz, plagioclase feldspar, mica and amphibole.These rocks include andesite, basalt, obsidian, pumice, rhyolite, scoria, and tuff. Pictures and brief descriptions of some common igneous rock types are shown on this page. Diorite is a coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock that contains a mixture of feldspar, pyroxene, hornblende and sometimes quartz. Igneous rocks are formed from the solidification of molten rock material. There are two basic types. Intrusive igneous rocks crystallize below Earth's surface and the slow cooling that occurs there allows large crystals to form. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are diorite, gabbro, granite, pegmatite, and peridotite. Extrusive igneous rocks erupt onto the surface where they cool quickly to form small crystals. Some cool so quickly that they form an amorphous glass
homeostatic control mechanism for heart rate	This process is an example of negative feedback. As for the control of the breathing rate, the medulla also controls the heart rate. The set process for the regulation of the heart rate is rather complex and is as follows. As an individual exercises, special receptors located within the muscles send impulses to the medulla. Blood glucose is another contributing factor to homeostasis. The blood glucose concentration in the blood is vital to the functioning of cells within the body and is controlled by a number of internal structures and external influence (food and drink).The body can control its inherent heart rate in a variety of ways. human body image by Alhazm Salemi from Fotolia.com. Homeostasis is derived from a Greek term that means same state. Biologically it refers to the way your body attempts to maintain constant internal conditions in an ever-changing external environment. The body can control internal conditions such as temperature, heart rate and blood pressure. It uses a monitoring system that detects outside conditions and makes the necessary hormonal changes to maintain a steady set point. The body can control heart rate using a variety of methods. During stress or exercise, your body will cause the heart rate to increase in order to meet metabolic needs. The adrenal gland, which lies on top of both kidneys, releases a hormone called epinephrine; this hormone travels to the heart and attaches to certain receptors, causing the heart rate to increase.
good source of potassium foods	1 Dark Leafy Greens Some of the best sources of potassium are dark leafy greens such as spinach, which when cooked has more than 800 mg of potassium per cup; bok choy, which contains around 600 mg per cup when boiled, and Swiss chard, which has almost 1,000 mg per cooked cup. Aside from energy and potassium, bananas are also a good source of fiber and vitamins B6 and C. For other high-potassium fresh fruits, enjoy cantaloupe, kiwi, oranges, and strawberries. 1  Getty Images Avocado If avocado isn’t a staple in your house yet, you should probably start adding it to your grocery list.Basic Description. Potassium is a mineral found in varying amounts in almost all foods. Vegetables, especially green leafy varieties, are generally our richest sources of potassium. We list three excellent sources of potassium, 16 as very good sources, and 39 as good sources by our Nutrient Rating System. Summary of Food Sources. Probably the first food that comes to mind when thinking about potassium is the banana. This is not wrong—by our Rating System, bananas are a good source of potassium. But there are 32 foods on our Rating Chart with more potassium per calorie than the banana. Speaking more generally, the most potassium-rich food sources of potassium are fruits and vegetables. Some legumes, fish, and dairy products can also make important contributions to our daily potassium intake; yet, because these foods have more calories, they are not as highly rated by our Nutrient Richness
how old do you have to be to not be penalized	Though you may take money out of your 401(k) to use as a down payment, expect to pay a 10 percent penalty. However, take the money from your IRA, and it's penalty-free. The penalty-free withdrawal is not limited to first-timers either. Homebuyers must not have owned a home in the previous two years, though. Further you can take more than one penalty-free withdrawal to buy a home, but there is a $10,000 limit. For example, says Rothstein, You can do two $5,000 withdrawals, but $10,000 is the lifetime limit.. Taking money out of a 401(k) for a down payment can be trickier. Now that you're properly chastised, if you do need to take a withdrawal, some hardship situations qualify for a penalty exemption from an IRA or a 401(k) plan. Note that penalty-free does not mean tax-free. All traditional IRA and 401(k) withdrawals require that you pay taxes at ordinary income rates.Take care to avoid these five significant retirement penalties: IRA early withdrawal penalty. If you withdraw money from your IRA before age 59½, you will generally have to pay a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty in addition to income tax on the amount withdrawn. So, if you withdraw $5,000 from your IRA at age 40, you’ll need to pay a $500 tax penalty. “You can withdraw without penalty if it’s money you contributed yourself.”.

how to cook a canned ham	Step 2: Baking the ham. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert an oven-safe thermometer into the center of the ham (it should not touch the bone of a bone-in ham). Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until ham registers desired temperature (140°F for cooked ham). Step 1: Preheating the oven and preparing the ham. Preheat the oven to 325°F. You do not need to wash a ham before baking. This versatile meat requires no embellishment; however, scoring a diamond pattern in the skinlike outer layer and brushing on a glaze during baking makes the ham a showy centerpiece and adds flavor.Take the canned ham out and place it in a medium sized roasting pan. Pour some apricot juice in the roasting pan. Have it fill up about 1/2 of an inch high. Open a can of sliced pineapples and lay them over the top of the ham. They can overlap each other. Cover the roasting pan with tin foil. Place the roasting pan in the oven for one hour at 350 degrees. You will know the ham is ready when the pineapples begin to darken in color. Remember that the ham is already cooked, you are just heating it up. It should take about 20 minutes per pound to become fully heated. Tips & Warnings. 1  You can also rub some brown sugar directly on the top and sides of the ham for a sweeter ham. 2  If you decide to cook your ham directly in the can it came in, make sure you poke some holes in the top. 3  Otherwise the steam will not be able to vent and it will scold you when you open it up.

what makes quicksand sink	Quicksand is a colloid hydrogel consisting of fine granular material (such as sand or silt), clay, and water. Quicksand forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). People falling into (and, unrealistically, being submerged in) quicksand or a similar substance is a trope of adventure fiction, notably in movies. According to Slate, this gimmick had its heyday in the 1960s, when almost 3% of all films showed someone sinking in mud, sand, or clay.Quicksand is an interesting natural phenomenon -- it is actually solid ground that has been liquefied by a saturation of water. The  quick  refers to how easily the sand shifts when in this semiliquid state. Quicksand is not a unique type of soil; it is usually just sand or another type of grainy soil. Quicksand is nothing more than a soupy mixture of sand and water. It can occur anywhere under the right conditions, according to Denise Dumouchelle, geologist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Quicksand is created when water saturates an area of loose sand and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand can't escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer support weight. There are two ways in which sand can become agitated enough to create quicksand:

outside air conditioning unit cost	There are two types of central air conditioning systems: A split system, which has a condenser unit outside and an evaporator unit inside, and a packaged system, in which the compressor and evaporator are in a single outdoor unit. Split units do not require duct work, while packaged units do. Adding central air conditioning to a home with an existing forced-air heating system in a 2,000-square-foot house averages $3,000 - $4,000. If ducts need to be added, the cost can double, and a split unit is the way to go. As opposed to window units, a ductless system is quieter, and can also heat your home. The higher the SEER rating, the higher the central air conditioner's cooling efficiency and the less electricity it will use, but the more expensive it will be to purchase. An additional factor to consider is the bel rating, or decibel level the unit produces. Units with a lower bel rating are typically priced higher.Most homeowners report spending between $3,675 and $7,155 to have air conditioning installed. This price is more typical of a central A/C unit installation rather than a window air conditioner addition which typically averages about $300. Your total cost for the job will depend on the type of system you choose. Many central air conditioning systems use the furnace blower to distribute cool air through the home. If you do not have a central heating system installed, it is cost-effective to install a heating and air conditioning (HVAC) system at the same time.
where is the vascular cambium located	Cork cambium (pl. cambia or cambiums) is a tissue found in many vascular plants as part of the periderm. The cork cambium is a lateral meristem and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the epidermis in roots and stems. It is found in woody and many herbaceous dicots, gymnosperms and some monocots (although monocots usually lack secondary growth). It is one of the many layers of bark, between the cork and primary phloem. The function of cork cambium is to produce the cork, a tough protective material. Synonyms for cork cambium are bark cambium, pericambium and phellogen.The shoot tissues arise from the shoot apical meristem as dermal tissue, ground tissue, and vascular tissue. Secondary meristems (vascular cambium and cork cambium) then add girth to the plant by adding secondary xylem, phloem, and cork. Top of Page. Shoot Apical Meristem: the apical meristem includes the a group of dividing cells that give rise to three primary meristematic tissues, protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium. Top of Page Secondary Stem Tissues: In dicots and gymnosperms the majority of the plant tissue is composed of secondary vascular tissues. Top of Page Vascular Cambium: The vascular cambium is a layer of meristematic tissue that lies between the primary phloem and primary xylem. As the vascular cambium adds new xylem cells toward the inside of the stem and phloem cells toward the outside of the stem, the vascular bundles eventually coalesce to form a complete ring

what is a mano artifact	In situ: Refers to an artifact that has been found in its original context. Lithic: Stone, or pertaining to stone. In archaeology, this term most often refers to a stone artifact. Mano: A hand-held stone used in food preparation to grind grains (such as corn and wheat) on a stone slab, known as a metate. Metate: A large stone slab that serves as the surface upon which to grind grains with a mano. Assemblage: A collection of artifacts that have been grouped together due to their collection from a common archaeological context. Biface: A stone tool that has been flaked on two sides. “Biface” is a broad term for a tool that cannot or has not been specifically identified as a projectile point, knife, axe, etc.It is more rare in the central and western areas although occasional specimens are found widely distributed throughout the state, including the Oklahoma Panhandle. The term boatstone which is commonly used to identify this artifact comes from the general boat shape of the stone. The boatstone served as a weight and charm for an atlatl or throwing stick. Similar stones have been found still attached to wooden atlatls in the Southwestern Basket Maker sites. Occasional specimens are sometimes incised with a simple design on the outside surface. There is also much variation in size with the range being from small examples 50 mm or less in length to large specimens measuring 130 mm or more in length. Most specimens, however, will have a length between 70 and 100 mm.
what is an average stride length for a woman	The Numbers. Stride length is measured from heel to heel and determines how far you walk with each step. On average, a man's walking stride length is 2.5 feet, or 30 inches, according to Arizona State University Extension. A woman's average stride length is 2.2 feet, or 26.4 inches, reports the school. In general, people with longer legs have a greater stride length than those with shorter legs. Another method is to step in a puddle of water, walk 10 steps and measure the stride length between three wet steps. Average those distances to find your average stride rate. For example, if you measure 29, 30 and 31 inches per step, you have an average stride length of 30 inches.Step 2. Determine your stride length using your height. While this is not as accurate as some other methods, it can give you a close estimate of your stride length. For women, simply multiply 0.413 by your height in centimeters. Men should multiply 0.415 by their height in centimeters. Some models ask for users to input their height and weight, which will determine your estimated stride length for you. Step 4. Determine your estimated stride by using the average stride lengths for men and women. An average man's stride length is 78 centimeters, while a woman's average stride length is 70 centimeters. Step 5. Measure your stride length by marking off a 50-foot-long area on a sidewalk or in your driveway, using a piece of chalk. Walk from one end of this area to the other, while counting your step
what type of rock is formed by volcanic activity	Best Answer: Igneous rocks are called fire rocks and are formed either underground or above ground. Underground, they are formed when the melted rock, called magma, deep within the earth becomes trapped in small pockets. As these pockets of magma cool slowly underground, the magma becomes igneous rocks. Igneous rocks are also formed when volcanoes erupt, causing the magma to rise above the earth's surface. When magma appears above the earth, it is called lava. Andesitic rocks (Andesite) or Diorite are usually formed by subduction zone (strato-or compositive volcanoes) at convergent boundaries. Rhyolite (formed above ground-extrusive) and granite (intrusive-formed under ground and usually never reaches the surface under eruption conditions).Volcanic rock (often shortened to volcanics in scientific contexts) is a rock formed from magma erupted from a volcano. In other words, it differs from other igneous rock by being of volcanic origin. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks and constitute an important element of some sediments and sedimentary rocks. For these reasons, in geology, volcanics and shallow hypabyssal rocks are not always ==Characteristics==. Pyroclastic rocks are the product of explosive volcanism. They are often felsic (high in silica). Pyroclastic rocks are often the result of volcanic debris, such as ash, bombs and tephra, and other volcanic ejecta.
average time to sell a business	Home. THE average time it takes to sell a house has fallen to eight months from 10 at the start of the year with prices expected to plunge 12% this year. There are now around 60,000 properties on the market, up from 20,000 at the peak of the housing boom. According to the latest report from property website Daft.ie, the average time to sell in Dublin is four months, which is similar to late 2008. However, in Munster, the duration is 10 months compared to a year in Connacht and Ulster. In Munster it took around five months to sell a property in 2008Only 28 percent reported that it took six months or less from listing to sale. Nine months, or longer, to sell a business  that’s hard to believe! Our last survey, conducted in 2006, stated that the average time between listing and sale was 7.9 months. At this rate, it won’t be long before it takes a year, or probably longer, to sell a business. Our survey also reported that the average listing period was 10.7 months. It seems to us that the way these time periods are increasing, listing periods are going to have to be at least a year or more. In fact, it wouldn’t surprise us if not too long from now, business brokers will have to take lifetime listings. A seller is usually most anxious to sell right after offering it for sale. One way to speed up the activity is for business brokers to have to tell the owner of a small business, who has a pressing need to sell, that it is going to take nine months or more to sell it.
what is crisis management	Ultimately, crisis management is designed to protect an organization and its stakeholders from threats and/or reduce the impact felt by threats. Crisis management is a process designed to prevent or lessen the damage a crisis can inflict on an organization and its stakeholders. As a process, crisis management is not just one thing. Crisis management can be divided into three phases: (1) pre-crisis, (2) crisis response, and (3) post-crisis. The pre-crisis phase is concerned with prevention and preparation. The crisis response phase is when management must actually respond to a crisis.Crisis management is the process by which an organization deals with a major event that threatens to harm the organization, its stakeholders, or the general public. The study of crisis management originated with the large-scale industrial and environmental disasters in the 1980s. It is considered to be the most important process in public relations. Three elements are common to a crisis: (a) a threat to the organization, (b) the element of surprise, and (c) a short decision time. Venette argues that crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained.. Crisis management is a situation-based management system that includes clear roles and responsibilities and process related organisational requirements company-wide. The response shall include action in the following areas: Crisis prevention, crisis assessment, crisis handling and crisis termination.
meaning of chant surname	Meaning of Chantelle: This is a variant spelling of Chantal, which is a French surname meaning place of stones..

De chantal it has erroneously been associated With the french, word chant.. meaning song 0 5. The meaning of Chantelle is  Stony, place of stones  and  Song . Its origin is  Modern English variant of the French name Chantal . Chantelle is a form of Chantal and is generally pronounced like  shan TELL . This name is mostly being used as a girls name.ORIGIN OF THE NAME By Michael Cheeseman 2005. The origins of the Chant surname, like most names, is shrouded in the mists of time. Surnames before the Norman Conquest of 1066 were rare in England, having been brought from mainland Europe by the Normans when William the Conquerer invaded their shores. One suggested origin of the surname of Chant, was that it derived from the Old French word Chante , a name given to a singer. No one can be one hundred percent certain of the true origin of any surname, when it was first used or what it s exact significance and meaning was. The Chant name it appears, was brought to England in the wake of the Norman Conquest of 1066. The name Cante (without surname), was listed as a tenant of the Domesday Book in 1086. In 1086 the compilation of the Domesday Book had been ordered by William the Conqueror(1027-87), King of England from 1066.
most boring city in wisconsin	There’s no denying it: there are plenty of places in Wisconsin that are downright beautiful and full of excitement. Unfortunately, not all towns and cities in WI are so lucky. Just like in all U.S. States, there are definitely some boring places within Wisconsin’s borders. You know the places: the ones where everyone has an AARP card and the most exciting thing they do all day is post a picture of their grandchild on Facebook. Like Hobart, for instance. In our latest analysis, we found that this city was the most boring city in all of Wisconsin. But don’t feel bad if you’re a resident of Hobart. There are plenty of other boring, lackluster places in Wisconsin as well. Here they are. Try not to jump out of your seat with excitement: Hobart; Mequon; Richfield; Muskego; Caledonia10 Facts You Probably Didn’t Know About Wisconsin. 1. Wisconsin is modest about its lakes. Minnesota’s official motto may be the “Land of 10,000 Lakes”, but Wisconsin is not one to brag. The lake count comes in somewhere over 15,000, but the Wisconsin DNR modestly publishes a listing of 16,692 lakes. 2. Madison wasn’t always the Capitol of Wisconsin. Belmont was the original. The capitol was established in 1836, when Wisconsin was not yet a state but a territory. You can still visit the Council House and a lodging house for then legislators at this historic site just west of Belmont Mound State Park. 3. The oldest city in Wisconsin isn’t Madison or even Milwaukee. It’s actually Green Bay.
fifo and weighted average method	To calculate using the weighted average method, divide the total cost of items in inventory available for sale by the total number of units available for sale. Let's look at our example. Again, Mega Irrigation had purchased 10 sprinklers for $10.00 and then 20 sprinklers for $20.00. FIFO is an acronym for first-in, first-out and means that the oldest inventory items are recorded as sold first. Essentially, FIFO assumes that inventory items are sold in the order in which they are acquired: inventory items bought first are the first ones to be sold, and inventory items bought later are sold later.Using the weighted average cost method, our closing inventory amounts to $1,059. This equates to a cost of $1.06 per lollypop ($1,059/1,000 lollypops). Oddly enough, the LIFO method is the preferred inventory valuation method in the United States but is disallowed in non-US countries. The FIFO method and the weighted average cost method are used in non-US countries. In recent years there have been calls for the standardization of accounting rules throughout the world, and talk specifically about disallowing LIFO in the US (or making the rest of the world follow the LIFO system). 2. This method assumes that the last inventories bought are the first ones to be sold, and that inventories bought first are sold last. The value of our closing inventories in this example would be calculated as follows: Using the Last-In-First-Out method, our closing inventory comes to $1,000.
what is global intermediary identification number	GIIN Composition GIIN means a Global Intermediary Identification Number assigned to a PFFI or Registered Deemed Compliant FFI. A separate GIIN will be issued to the FI to identify each jurisdiction, including the FI’s jurisdiction of residence, in which the FI maintains a branch that is not treated as a Limited Branch. It is anticipated that the IRS FFI list will be updated on a monthly basis to add or remove FIs (or their branches). The FATCA ID is not the same as the GIIN. • The Financial Institution Type can be Single, Lead of an Expanded Affiliated Group, Member (not Lead) of an Expanded Affiliated Group, or Sponsoring Entity. The Financial Institution type is provided by the Financial Institution when creating its FATCA account.The GIIN may be used by an FI to identify itself to withholding agents and tax administrations for FATCA reporting. A GIIN will be issued to only those FIs that are not Limited FFIs, Limited Branches, or U.S. branches of an FFI, and will be issued after an FI’s FATCA Registration is submitted and approved.

what is adsorption	Adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface. This process creates a film of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the absorbate) permeates or is dissolved by a liquid or solid (the absorbent). Adsorption is a surface-based process while absorption involves the whole volume of the material. Similar to surface tension, adsorption is a consequence of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent, or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms inAdsorption Definition. Adsorption is defined as the adhesion of a chemical species onto the surface of particles. German physicist Heinrich Kayser coined the term adsorption in 1881. Adsorption is a different process from absorption, in which a substance diffuses into a liquid or solid to form a solution. In adsorption, the gas or liquid particles bind to the solid or liquid surface that is termed the adsorbent. The particles form an atomic or molecular adsorbate film. Isotherms are used to describe adsorption because temperature has a significant effect on the process. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon in which particles or molecules bind to the top layer of a material. Absorption, on the other hand, goes deeper, involving the entire volume of the absorbent. Absorption is the filling of pores or holes in a substance.
what is a tombolo	A tombolo is a sandbar that connects the mainland to an island, forming a permanent or temporary isthmus, and the island can be known as a tied island. Tombolos form from sand or sediment pushed along a shoreline. Yes. An isthmus can exist between two large landforms or between an island and a larger landform or continent. It is any narrow connecting neck of land. A tombolo is a sandbar … that connects the mainland to an island, forming a permanent or temporary isthmus, and the island can be known as a tied island. Tombolos form from sand or sediment pushed along a shoreline. 1 person found this usefulTombolo near Karystos, Euboea, Greece. A tombolo, from the Italian tombolo, derived from the Latin tumulus, meaning 'mound', and sometimes translated as ayre, is a deposition landform in which an island is attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a spit or bar. Once attached, the island is then known as a tied island. Several islands tied together by bars which rise above the water level are called a tombolo cluster. Two or more tombolos may form an enclosure (called a lagoon) that can eventually fill with sediment. A tombolo may be considered to be a type of isthmus. As waves near an island, they are slowed by the shallow water surrounding it. These waves then bend around the island to the opposite side as they approach. The wave pattern created by this water movement causes a convergence of longshore drift on the opposite side of the island.
recommended dosage for amoxicillin	You can take amoxicillin with or without food. A common dose of amoxicillin for an adult with a mild to moderate ear, nose, or throat infection is 500 mg every 12 hours or 250 mg every 8 hours until the prescription is finished. For a more severe infection, a common dose of amoxicillin is 875 mg every 12 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours. A common dose of amoxicillin for a child (older than 3 months) with a lower respiratory tract infection is 40 mg per kilogram (kg) of weight per day in divided doses every 8 hours. Or, doctors sometimes want the child to take 45 mg per kg per day in divided doses every 12 hours. Amoxicillin is used to treat many different types of infections caused by bacteria, such as ear infections, bladder infections, pneumonia, gonorrhea, and E. coli or salmonella infection. The most common side effects reported with Amoxil use include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis.The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXIL, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days. The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXIL and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily (every 8 hours) for 14 days. Please refer to clarithromycin and lansoprazole full prescribing information. Tablets: Each tablet contains 500 mg or 875 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate. Each film-coated, capsule-shaped, pink tablet is debossed with AMOXIL centered over 500 or 875, respectively.
why is it called false ribs	The next three pairs of bones (8, 9 and 10) are called false ribs. These bones are slightly shorter than the true ribs and are connected to the spine in back, but not connected directly to the sternum in the front. The false ribs are attached to the lowest true rib that provides connection to the sternum. Rib Cage - Side View. The last two pairs of bones are called floating ribs. Floating ribs are smaller than the true ribs and the false ribs. They are attached to the spine at the back, but are not connected to anything in the front. The front floats free, hence their name floating ribs. It is much easier to see the floating ribs in the rib cage side view diagram to the right. The bottom two ribs (11 and 12) are clearly not attached to the front sternum. They are also not attached to other ribs as with the false ribs. The twelve pairs of ribs are often called the rib cage..Each pair of ribs is attached to the building blocks of the spine (the vertebrae) in the back. The 12 pairs of ribs consist of: True ribs: The first seven ribs attach to the sternum (the breast bone) in the front and are known as true (or sternal) ribs. False ribs: The lower five ribs do not directly connect to the sternum and are known as false ribs. The upper three false ribs connect to the costal cartilages of the ribs just above them. The last two false ribs, however, usually have no ventral attachment (no anchor at all in front) and are called floating, fluctuating or vertebral ribs.
do router boxes have the default ip	We've all been there, fruitlessly pecking in combinations of 192.168.x.x. Unless you have every default router address tattooed on your forearm, you'll eventually encounter one that stumps you. When that happens, you can typically find the information with a simple command on Windows. Open the command prompt (Start > Run/Search for cmd) and then enter ipconfig. The address you need should be next to Default Gateway under your Local Area Connection, and it will often begin with 192.168. If for some reason you can't retrieve the router's IP address using that method, we've compiled a brief list of popular router brands and their common default addresses. The list includes most router manufacturers with more than a dozen or so models, particularly if they deviate from the standard 192.168.1.1 address.You need to check the local IP address of your Linksys router since it is used to access the router’s web-based setup page. This is also the Default Gateway that is configured on your computer’s Ethernet adapter when it connects to the network. It is important to check the local IP address to make sure that you are using the correct address and you are accessing your own router. The default local IP address of Linksys routers is 192.168.1.1. IMPORTANT: Before checking the IP address of your Linksys router, make sure that your computer is connected to it wirelessly or using an Ethernet cable.

does estrogen produce glycogen	Estradiol stimulates the maturation of vaginal epithelium and its production of glycogen. Glycogen is broken down into glucose, which in turn is metabolized by vaginal lactobacilli, leading to control of the growth of vaginal pathogens via hydrogen peroxide production. There is no question that estadiol, or more accurately Estradiol-17B, results in an increased deposition of glycogen in cervical and vaginal tissues. Progesterone, cortisol, and testosterone do not elicit a vaginal glycogen response. In fact, cortical hormones repress the glycogen response, another reason stress intensifies vulvovaginal symptoms. 7. Vaginal, vulva and cervical health is largely dependent upon the microorganisms that colonize their surfacesAs estrogen levels decrease, glycogen is no longer secreted by the vaginal walls. Loss of lactobacilli creates a more alkaline environment, allowing for colonization of the vagina by fecal flora and other pathogens, resulting in a change in both quality and quantity of vaginal secretions.

average dose for ct scan	1 For patients not covered by health insurance, the typical cost of a calcium scoring heart CT scan is $50 to $350, while the typical cost of CT angiography ranges from $500 to $1,000. 2  For example, the Heart & Vascular Hospital at Sanford in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, offers calcium scoring scans for $50. 1 For patients covered by health insurance, typical out-of-pocket costs typically range from nothing to a copay or coinsurance of 10 to 20 percent, up to $200 for a $1,000 procedure. 2  An example is BlueCross BlueShield of New Mexico HMO plans, which require prior authorization but charge no copay for a cardiac CT scan.Radiation dose from CT scans of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis varies depending on the individual patient, and the technique used. In general, in adults, most abdomen CTs are performed at approximately 10 mSv. The dose is less for a chest CT. The doses should be the same-to-less, if size adjusted, for children. Head CT doses are generally less than about 2-4 mSv. As a rough approximation, one abdomen pelvis CT in an adult is equal to 100-250 chest x-rays. The average background radiation (just from living…) that individuals get is about 3-3.5 mSv per year. That is, 4 examinations at 5.0 mSv each done over three years is the equivalent of 20 mSv of dose (4x5=20). This is accumulated over the lifetime. Similarly, if quarterly abdominal CT scans (at 10 mSv each) were given for 5 years, the cumulative dose would be 4x10x5 mSv = 200 mSv. 3.

what are red blood cells	The primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen to body cells and deliver carbon dioxide to the lungs. A red blood cell has what is known as a biconcave shape. Both sides of the cell's surface curve inward like the interior of a sphere.This shape aids in a red blood cell's ability to maneuver through tiny blood vessels to deliver oxygen to organs and tissues.Red blood cells are also important in determining human blood type. Blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain identifiers on the surface of red blood cells.These identifiers, also called antigens, help the body's immune system to recognize it's own red blood cell type.his enables oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse across the red blood cell's plasma membrane more readily. Red blood cells contain enormous amounts of a protein called hemoglobin. This iron containing molecule binds oxygen as oxygen molecules enter blood vessels in the lungs.A red blood cell, or erythrocyte, is the most common type of cell in blood. It carries oxygen throughout the circulatory system, from the lungs to the rest of the body, and brings carbon dioxide waste back the other way. Chicada-Your bone marrow produces your red blood cells. In some cases bone marrow will produce too many red blood cells, other times red blood cell count may be high because of overproduction of proteins in the liver. Poor lung and heart function can also be a reason for the increase in your red blood cell count.
what happens when you sprain something	Points To Remember About Sprains and Strains A sprain is an injury to a ligament (tissue that connects two or more bones at a joint). When a sprain happens, one or more ligaments is stretched or torn. A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon (fibrous cords of tissue that connect muscle to bone). In a strain, a muscle or tendon is stretched or torn. Anyone can get a sprain or strain. Sprains happen most often in the ankle. However, if you fall and land on their hand, you can sprain your wrist. Skiing and other sports can make it more likely for you to sprain your thumb. Strains are most common in your back and the hamstring muscle in the back of your thigh.With most sprains, you feel pain right away at the site of the tear. Often the ankle starts to swell immediately and may bruise. The ankle area is usually tender to touch, and it hurts to move it. In more severe sprains, you may hear and/or feel something tear, along with a pop or snap. You will probably have extreme pain at first and will not be able to walk or even put weight on your foot. Usually, the more pain and swelling you have, the more severe your ankle sprain is and the longer it will take to heal. How is an ankle sprain diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you how the injury occurred and if you have hurt your ankle before. He or she will check your foot and ankle, your lower leg, and even your knee to see if you are hurt anywhere else. If the sprain is mild, your doctor may not order X-rays.
what are the different regions of the sarcomere	Muscle fibers are composed of tubular myofibrils. Myofibrils are composed of repeating sections of sarcomeres, which appear under the microscope as dark and light bands. Sarcomeres are composed of long, fibrous proteins as filaments that slide past each other when a muscle contracts or relaxes. The myosin head also binds to ATP, which is the source of energy for muscle movement. Myosin can only bind to actin when the binding sites on actin are exposed by calcium ions. Actin molecules are bound to the Z line, which forms the borders of the sarcomere. Other bands appear when the sarcomere is relaxed. A muscle fiber from a biceps muscle may contain 100,000 sarcomerMyofibrils are constructed and lined up in a chain-like formation to create what are called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres contain several regions. One region is called the A-bands and only consist of myosin filaments. The counterpart of A-bands is the I-bands that only contain actin filaments. The ends of each sarcomere are called Z discs. A middle region of each sarcomere called the H-zone only contains myosin. According to the sliding filament theory by Andrew Huxley and Ralph Niedergerke, muscles contract when Z-discs come closer together thus shortening the sarcomeres. As this overlap occurs, myosin filaments are binding to the actin filaments, allowing myosin to function as the driving motor of filament sliding. This relative movement between myosin and actin is what results in muscle contraction.
what type of keratin is in nails	The difference in durabilities of epidermal and hair keratins in nail against 2-mercaptoethanol suggests that two different types of the keratin filaments which are composed of epidermal or hair keratin polypeptides may have differing structural features, despite of co-existence in nail. We investigated nail keratins obtained by sequential extraction with increasing reducing agent concentrations (50 mM and 200 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and examined each of the extracted keratins by gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. It was found that nail contained epidermal and hair keratins. With 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, only epidermal type of keratins including skin differentiation specific-keratin could be extracted, whereas hair type of keratins required 200 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for extraction from nail. These results may indicate that nail has unique properties with respect to it's keratin compositionsKeratin is an extremely strong protein that is a major component in skin, hair, nails, hooves, horns, and teeth. The amino acids which combine to form it have several unique properties and, depending on the levels of the various amino acids, it can be inflexible and hard, like hooves, or soft, as is the case with skin. Some people use keratin hair products to help damaged hair regain elasticity and strength. Keratin can be used to strengthen brittle nails, which may occur as a result of constant submersion in water. Keratinocytes produce the skin's keratin.
what is refined sugar found in	Sucrose is a common, naturally occurring carbohydrate found in many plants and plant parts. Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula C12H22O11. Sucrose is often extracted and refined from either cane or beet sugar for human consumption. Modern industrial sugar refinement processes often involves bleaching and crystallization also, producing a white, odorless, crystalline powder with a sweet taste of pure sucrose, devoid of vitamins and minerals. Sucrose is found naturally in many food plants along with the monosaccharide fructose. In many fruits, such as pineapple and apricot, sucrose is the main sugar. In others, such as grapes and pears, fructThey are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water. Sucrose is found in the stems of sugar cane and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. Lactose is the naturally occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is formed by the combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion.
limit carbs maintain weight	Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs. Percent of Calories. According to the Institute of Medicine, children and adults should consume 45 to 65 percent of their calorie intake as carbohydrates, and at least 130 grams of carbs per day.1. Don’t Try to Limit Fat. “Eating high-fat foods keeps you from feeling deprived,” says Dr. Westman. Bacon, cheese, heavy cream, sour cream, cream cheese, mayonnaise, butter, and oil are all healthy parts of a low-carb diet. 2. Say Goodbye to Pasta, Bread, and Rice. To lose weight, most people have to stay under 20 grams of “net” carbs per day (net carbs refers to the number of grams of carbs minus grams of fiber, because fiber doesn’t send blood sugar spiking). But you can have up to four cups daily of leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach, and collard greens. Limit broccoli, cauliflower, green peppers, okra, and Brussels sprouts to two cups per day. 4. Say No to Hidden Sugars. Fruit, that legendarily healthful food, is packed with sugar, aka carbohydrates. So are fruit juices. Other concentrated sources include soda, cakes, and candy. You may be able to keep diet sodas, light beer, dry wine, and sugar-free sweets on the menu and still lose weight

what type of bonds are formed during translation	It houses the mRNA and tRNA strands as they work through the process of translation. mRNA codons match to tRNA anticodons. tRNA molecules carry in the amino acids. The peptide bonds that link amino acids are formed by the release of water molecules. A chain of amino acids is also called a polypeptide. 'Poly' means 'many,' just like in the word 'polymer,' and 'peptide' refers to a peptide bond, so a molecule with many peptide bonds is called a polypeptide. If a polypeptide is the final product that we get from translation, then the peptide bonds are like the mixing of the ingredients in our skillet.Peptide bond-A carbon-nitrogen chemical bond formed between amino acid subunits of a polypeptide chain. Peptidyl site-A three nucleotide position in a ribosome in which peptidyl tRNA is found. Peptidyl RNA-The name given to the tRNA located in the P site of the ribosome during translation. This tRNA holds the growing polypeptide chain. Peptidyl transferase-The enzyme responsible for catalyzing the peptide bond formation reaction between amino acids in the P site and A site of a ribosome during translation. Anticodon-The sequence of three nucleotides located on the anticodon arm of the tRNA cloverleaf structure. The anticodon bonds in antiparallel fashion with a codon of mRNA at the acceptor site of a ribosome during translation. Small subunit-The smaller of two prokaryotic ribosomal subunits. Responsible for binding to the ribosome binding site on the mRNA

what kind of antigens and antibodies are in type a blood	Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells. A blood type (also called a blood group) is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). 1 Blood group A individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the B antigen. 2  Therefore, a group A individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups A or O (with A being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type A or AB.Our blood is composed of blood cells and an aqueous fluid known as plasma. Human blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain identifiers on the surface of red blood cells. These identifiers, also called antigens, help the body's immune system to recognize it's own red blood cell type. There are four main ABO blood type groupings: A, B, AB, and O. These blood groups are determined by the antigen on the blood cell surface and the antibodies present in the blood plasma. Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are specialized proteins that identify and defend against foreign intruders to the body. 1 The antigens on the blood cell are B and the antibodies in the blood plasma are A. 2  Type AB: The genotype is AB. 3  The antigens on the blood cell are A and B. There are no A or B antibodies in the blood plasma. 4  Type O: The genotype is OO.
what does the law say about cctv warning signs	Video surveillance, however, is rarely required by law. One that does come to mind is ATM facilities in New York City, which I believe must have CCTV coverage. But property owners are not required to install and supervise CCTV. More often than not CCTV is installed by property owners as a measure to reduce property damage or to record the damage for possible police investigation after the fact. Some property complexes do have CCTV with on-site guard monitoring and certainly the presence of CCTV does raise the question of liability. A landlord of a residential property has a duty to provide reasonable security when the property is known to be in a high crime area and that tenants are likely to be at risk. Also, there are laws that affect the landlord's duty to provide some level of protection, such as front door locks and intercom systems.The DATA PROTECTION ACT 1998 requires that your CCTV system is registered with some exceptions. This might include your CCTV system! You must conform to Data Protection Act law for CCTV systems if you operate a CCTV system in a public place or workplace for the purpose of targeting individuals. No need to worry (we tell you why later). Management of a CCTV system to keep within Data Protection Act law needs to have proper checklists, forms, CCTV warning signs and procedures tied together by a CODE OF PRACTICE. Without all of this you might as well not have registered, because you are still not complying with the Act
what kind of government does haiti have	It is a semi-presidential republic system whereby the President of Haiti is head of state directly elected by popular vote. The Prime Minister acts as head of government, and … is appointed by the President from the majority party in the National Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the President and Prime Minister who together constitute the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the National Embassy of Haiti.

Which term is also known as vomiting	Problems with nausea and vomiting are related to the cause. Nausea and vomiting from motion sickness, seasickness, food poisoning, or cancer therapy can result in loss of water and electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration. Vomiting and nausea known as morning sickness may occur during pregnancy. 1  Nausea is an unpleasant, queasy feeling in the throat or stomach that may result in vomiting. 2  Vomiting is emptying the stomach as a result of strong gagging and retching that leads to throwing up. The following are common causes of nausea and vomiting: 1  Side effects of anesthesia used for surgery. 2  Stomach problems such as blockage (pyloric obstruction, a condition that causes forceful spitting up in infants). 3  Bleeding into the stomach from different causes. 4  Infection, irritation, or blockage of the intestines.By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD. The term vomiting describes the forceful expulsion of the contents of the stomach via the mouth or sometimes the nose, also known of as emesis. The causes of vomiting are as wide ranging as those for nausea and include anything from food poisoning or gastritis to head injuries and brain cancer. Regurgitation is a different condition from vomiting and the term regurgitation usually means expulsion of the undigested food from the food pipe or esophagus into the mouth, with none of the forceful expulsion or discomfort that is associated with nausea. The two conditions are different as are their underlying causes
what nutrients are in onions	Research has made the benefits of knowing the nutritional facts of vegetables clear: An active lifestyle combined with a high intake of fruits and vegetables have been associated with a variety of health benefits highlighted in the health research section. Onion Nutrition Facts. Serving Size 1 cup (160g). Onion Nutrition Facts. In the rush to gather health information on the processed foods we eat, it can be easy to forget to check the nutritional facts of vegetables like the onion. Onions are high in vitamin C, a good source of fiber, and with only 45 calories per serving, add abundant flavor to a wide variety of food. Onions are sodium, fat, and cholesterol free, and provide a number of other key nutrientsThis chart graphically details the %DV that a serving of Onions provides for each of the nutrients of which it is a good, very good, or excellent source according to our Food Rating System. Additional information about the amount of these nutrients provided by Onions can be found in the Food Rating System Chart.

There's research evidence for including at least one serving of an allium vegetable—such as onions—in your meal plan every day.
lung capacity and how long a person can hold their breath	You are literally stretching out your lungs so that they can hold more air. The average human female has a capacity of four liters, and the average male six liters. Endurance training can increase those numbers, but only slightly. Lung packing, however, can add up to three liters to a person's lungs. One diver named Herbert Nitsch even has a reported 14-liter capacity. Cyclist Miguel Indurain has massive lungs for a non-diver (8 liters), and they were reportedly large enough to displace his stomach, which gave him a trademark paunch. Chances are you won't need to hold your breath for 20 minutes in your lifetime, or even 5 minutes. But the capacity to improve how long you can hold it now into something that seems, on the surface, totally unrealistic remains fascinatingThe current record for pure breath-holding is 22 minutes, set by Stig Severinson in May of last year. And you probably remember David Blaine sitting in a bubble for 17 minutes 4 seconds. That is far longer than the 30 or 40 seconds most of us can hold for, to a really phenomenal degree.

Your Your Social Security retirement benefit payment is also affected by the age at which you decide to retire. You can retire as early as age 62, but if you retire before your full retirement age, your benefits will be permanently reduced, based on your age. For example, if you retire at age 62, your benefit would be about 25 percent lower than what it would be if you waited until you reach full retirement age. If Health Problems Force You to Retire Early. Sometimes health problems force people to retire early. If you cannot work because of health problems, you should consider applying for Social Security disability benefits. The amount of the disability benefit is the same as a full, unreduced retirement benefit.
average earth temp	The distance from Earth to the sun is one of the most important factors in making Earth habitable. The next closest planet to the sun, Venus, for example, is the hottest planet in the solar system. Temperatures there reach more than 750 F (400 C), while the average temperature on Mars is minus 80 F (minus 60 C). Earth's atmosphere also play a vital role in regulating the temperature by providing a blanket of gases that not only protects us from excessive heat and harmful radiation from the sun, but also traps heat rising from the Earth's interior, keeping us warm. The average temperature on Earth is about 61 degrees F (16 C). But temperatures vary greatly around the world depending on the time of year, ocean and wind currents and weather conditions. Summers tend to be warmer and winters colder. Also, temperatures tend to be higher near the equator and lower near the polesChange over time. Earth’s average annual surface temperature is higher today than it was when record keeping began in the mid-to late 1800s, an indicator of long-term, global-scale climate warming. All of the top ten warmest years in the record have occurred since the last major El Nino niño, event in. 1998 Earth’s average annual surface temperature is higher today than it was when record keeping began more than a century ago. The red line shows how far above or below the 1981–2010 average (dashed line at zero) the combined land and ocean temperature has been each year since 1880.
describe vascular tissue in plants	The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant. The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells. In stems and roots, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem.Vascular plants (from Latin vasculum: duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term trachea) and also higher plants, form a large group of plants that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. 1 Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. 2  This feature allows vascular plants to evolve to a larger size than non-vascular plants, which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are therefore restricted to relatively small sizes.
what solution is the highest concentration of water	Greater movement of water from pure water to the dilute solution. If a selectively permeable membrane separates the two solutions, water moves through it in both directions at the same time. However, more water leaves a dilute solution (high water concentration) and passes into a more concentrated solution (low water concentration) than enters it. Although the water appears to move across the membrane in one direction, it is in fact moving in both directions but more one way than the other. When the concentration of water is the same on both sides of the membrane, the movement of water will be the same in both directions. Pure water has the highest water concentration possible. As more salt or sugar is dissolved the water concentration decreases. A concentration gradient [concentration gradient: A difference in concentration between two areas next to each other. Particles will move down the concentration gradient from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.] is where there is a high water concentration in one area and a lower water concentration in another.Water has a very low molecular weight, so its molarity in itself is one of the highest. If you want to go to extremes, the highest concentration I can think of is the concentration of water in any miscible liquid. Water by itself is 55M, so if you were to place a drop of alcohol or acetic acid into it, the concentration of water would remain essentially at that value: 55M.

does the bank pay you for making a savings account	1 You open a savings account at the bank. 2  The bank pays you interest on the money that you deposit and leave in that account. 3  The bank then loans that money out to other people, only they charge a slightly higher interest rate on the loan than what they pay you for your account.nterest is money the bank pays you so that they can use your money to fund loans for other people. That doesn't mean you can't have your money whenever you want it, though. That's just how banks make money -- by selling money! Basically, it works like this: 1  You open a savings account at the bank.Let's say you deposit your money in a savings account. The bank will pay you for every dollar you keep in your savings account. The money the bank pays you is called interest. How much the bank pays can change from month to month.The amount the bank pays is talked about as a percentage.If the bank is paying 3% interest, the bank will pay you 3¢ for every dollar you deposit in your account.Why does the bank pay you? The bank wants to use your money to make loans – that is, lend people money. People often borrow money from the bank to buy expensive things, like houses and cars.y the end of the year, your neighbor had paid the bank $450 in interest. The bank made $300 by loaning money – even after paying you $150 in interest. So banks make their money by working with both savers and borrowers. Don't worry – whenever you give money to a bank, the federal government insures it.
what temperature to cook prime rib	4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°)Sear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast.

what does the brain do in the nervous system	The autonomic nervous system regulates certain body processes, such as blood pressure and the rate of breathing, that work without conscious effort, according to Merck Manuals. The somatic system consists of nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord with muscles and sensory receptors in the skin. The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons, ganglia (clusters of neurons) and nerves that connect to one another and to the central nervous system. Functionally, the nervous system has two main subdivisions: the somatic, or voluntary, component; and the autonomic, or involuntary, component.The nervous system is the part of an animal 's body that coordinates its voluntary and involuntary actions and transmits signals to and from different parts of its body. Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago. In vertebrate species it consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS contains the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every other part of the body. The central nervous system functions to send signals from one cell to others, or from one part of the body to others and to receive feedback. Malfunction of the nervous system can occur as a result of genetic defects, physical damage due to trauma or toxicity, infection or simply of ageing.
how to get ip address on unix	You can do : ip addr | grep 'state UP' -A2 | tail-n1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut-f1 -d'/'. which gives you the first private IP address listed in ip addr. For example, with ip addr, I get: With the commandline before, I get 192.168.0.85 which is the IP address of em1.To put it in a variable inside a shell script, you can do var=$(ip addr | grep 'state UP' -A2 | tail-n1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut-f1 -d'/') . Now, until the end of the script, $var will have the value of the IP address.hich gives you the first private IP address listed in ip addr. For example, with ip addr, I get: With the commandline before, I get 192.168.0.85 which is the IP address of em1. To put it in a variable inside a shell script, you can do var=$(ip addr | grep 'state UP' -A2 | tail-n1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut-f1 -d'/') .To look up an IP address in Unix, you'll need to know the full name of the computer you're looking up. At the Unix shell prompt, enter one of the following commands:Replace machine-name with the name of the computer you want to look up, and domain.name with the rest of that computer's address.Note the following: 1  Some newer Unix and Linux distributions do not include the nslookup command, and instead use either host or dig to look up IP addresses.

a major disadvantage of a flexible work force is that	Manufacturing and warehouse facilities need consistent employee coverage to operate smoothly. Jupiterimages/Creatas/Getty Images. Your company's flexible workforce structure can accommodate employees with transportation or personal issues that keep them from working a standard schedule. Your company's success depends on its ability to satisfy its customers and interact with its vendors. To provide exemplary customer service, your front office, retail store, purchasing department or other service-focused entity must always have capable employees on hand. Operating with a flexible workforce can result in reduced or nonexistent coverage at certain timesThe Advantages of a Core Workforce. Core employees are not identified until the company's vision and goals are defined. Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images. Companies may divide their workforce into two major groups, peripheral or flexible and core. A peripheral or flexible workforce includes employees that are only temporary or that do not contribute to the most essential tasks the business must complete. A core workforce includes employees who perform the vital activities of the company. This is much harder to do with a flexible workforce because the number of employees, and thus the skill and knowledge set available, is not reliable. With a concrete plan in place, managers can measure what the employees are doing and provide specific information to investors and others interested in the company.

what is spinal spinalstenosis	Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the open spaces within your spine, which can put pressure on your spinal cord and the nerves that travel through the spine to your arms and legs. Spinal stenosis occurs most often in the lower back and the neck.While spinal stenosis may cause no signs or symptoms in some people, other people may experience pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness, and problems with normal bladder or bowel function.Spinal stenosis is most commonly caused by wear-and-tear changes in the spine related to osteoarthritis.In severe cases of spinal stenosis, doctors may recommend surgery to create additional space for the spinal cord or nerves.pinal stenosis is most commonly caused by wear-and-tear changes in the spine related to osteoarthritis. In severe cases of spinal stenosis, doctors may recommend surgery to create additional space for the spinal cord or nerves.Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing (stenosis) of the spinal canal that may occur in any of the regions of the spine. This narrowing causes a restriction to the spinal canal, resulting in a neurological deficit.Symptoms include pain, numbness, paraesthesia, and loss of motor control.horacic spinal stenosis, at the level of the mid-back, is much less common. In lumbar stenosis, the spinal nerve roots in the lower back are compressed which can lead to symptoms of sciatica (tingling, weakness, or numbness that radiates from the low back and into the buttocks and legs).
indigenous species definition	Non-native species are species that have been introduced into new areas that have not historically been part of their native range. 'Exotic,' 'alien,' 'nonindigenous,' and 'introduced' are all synonymous terms referring to non-native species. In contrast, native species are species that have historically occurred as part of an ecosystem in a specific location. Native species are also called indigenous species. Introduction is defined by Krueger and May (1991) as the transfer by humans of an organism outside its native range. Exotic species have the potential to become invasive when they are released into a new environment. Invasive nonindigenous species are those species whose introduction causes, or is likely to cause, significant economic or environmental harm. Not all non-native species become invasive when released to novel systems.Examples. There are two types of native species, indigenous and endemic. Indigenous species are native species that are found in multiple locations, whereas endemic species are only found in a specific, unique location. We often find endemic species in geographically isolated areas such as islands. Definition. You may not be living in the same place you were born, or even the same place you grew up. But you likely still call that place 'home.' Like you, other plant and animal species may live far from where they originated. Those that do live in the same place they are originally from are called native species.

what caused the surface texture of lava	Once cooled, pahoehoe and `a`a are easily identifiable by their characteristic textures. Pahoehoe has a smooth, billowy, ropy surface and has at times been likened to the surface texture of a pan of chocolate brownies. On the other hand, `a`a has a rough, jagged and clinkery surface.he threat they pose is largely dependent on how the flow moves, which is in turn determined by the properties of the lava and the landscape. The two main types of lava, pahoehoe and `a`a, differ in various properties, such as crystal and gas bubble content, as well as having slight differences in temperature.Lava: The term used for magma once it has erupted onto the Earth's surface. Molten rock that erupts from a vent or fissure. Lava flow: Stream of molten rock that erupts relatively non-explosively from a volcano and moves slowly downslope. An outpouring of lava onto the land surface from a vent or fissure.Also, a solidified tongue-like or sheet-like body formed by outpouring lava.Pahoehoe: Pahoehoe (pronounced pah-hoy-hoy - a Hawaiian term), is a very fluid lava flow, that in solidified form, is characterized by a smooth, billowy, or ropy surfaces.he fluid nature of the bomb causes the lava to flow outward from the center of the impact, forming a roughly circular, pancake-shaped bomb. Fusiform bombs-Also called spindle or almond bombs. These bombs have an elongated form which tapers down at each end, with a relatively smooth surface. Many have an almond shape.
what is glucosamine in food	Glucosamine and chondroitin are part of normal cartilage. Cartilage acts as a cushion between the bones in a joint. Glucosamine, also called chitosamine, is a natural substance that is found in the covering of shellfish. It is available in different forms, including glucosamine hydrochloride, N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG), and glucosamine sulfate, which is a combination of glucosamine and mineral salt. If you are allergic to shellfish, do not take glucosamine unless you have talked to your doctor. Some glucosamine is made from shellfish covering. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate dietary supplements in the same way it regulates medicines.Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetylglucosamine. Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a likely effective rating for treating osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. It is produced commercially by the hydrolysis of crustacean exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat. Glucosamine appears to be safe for use as a dietary supplement; effectiveness has not been established for any condition. In the US it is one of the most common non-vitamin, non-mineral, dietary supplements used by adult
what is a seeder	If everyone just downloaded the file from the uploader and stopped seeding without seeding the torrent 1:1 then the uploader will always be stuck seeding. Which the speed of the torrent will hardly go up because the leechers will always outnumber the seeder. So it is important to seed back at least what you take. SEEDS(uppers) & LEECHERS(downloaders) In the begining while downloading a torrent for the first time you are a leecher because the download hasn't completed. When it completes you switch to a seeder and dedicate that stream to simply uploading. The more seeds available the faster the download. Seeding is the process of connecting to a torrent when you have a complete file. Yes it is important to seed 1 to 1. The more seeders there are on a torrent the faster the torrent is. You are not downloading the torrent from the actual site you get it from. You are downloading it off another user that has it on their computerAll users who have the torrent open make up what is called a swarm. Technically, a seeder is someone who has 100-percent of the pieces that make up the torrent. Initially, the first few leachers within a swarm feed off the seeder. The more seeders the faster the download will go.    Leechers are people who has a negative effect on  the swarm of the torrent. Leechers are commonly the users who  download much than they upload.

what is roux in cooking	A roux-based sauce. Roux /ˈruː/ (also rue) is flour and fat cooked together and used as to thicken sauces. The fat is butter in French cuisine, but may be lard or vegetable oil in other cuisines. A roux is used in three of the mother sauces of classical French cooking: bechamel béchamel, sauce veloute, velouté sauce and. espagnole sauce Dark roux is often made with vegetable oils, which have a higher smoke point than butter, and are used in Cajun and Creole cuisine for gumbos and stews. The darker the roux, the less thickening power it has; a chocolate roux has about one-fourth the thickening power, by weight, of a white roux.A thickening agent made from fat mixed with flour that is cooked together to be used to stiffen the texture of sauces, gravies, and soups. All-purpose flour is most commonly used for making a Roux. It has moderate levels of starch and protein, so the thickening power is also moderate. The more starch content in the flour, the thicker the Roux as flour is the key ingredient that determines the thickness of the texture. As the flour combines with the fat and is heated the starch expands, thus creating the thickness in texture. The longest cooking time is used for making the brown Roux, most often used for the preparation of Cajun and Creole food dishes. The brown Roux requires 8 to 16 minutes (or longer at times) for heating and cooking the mixture, enabling it to become brown in color with a more intense nut-like aroma.

what temperature for goldfish water	Goldfish are considered cold-water fish, but although they can survive a wide range of temperatures, that does not mean they are happy or healthy in cold water. Goldfish can survive temperatures from forty degrees to one hundred six degrees, but the extremes will kill the goldfish if th e exposure lasts too long. In situations such as purchasing a goldfish in a store at seventy degrees, to place it in a pond outdoors, with a temperature of forty, it may take days or weeks of careful preparation to avoid a high chance of death. If the water is too cold, there are various heaters and thermostats available for aquariums.Their body temperature is determined by the temperature of the water. This means that goldfish are at the mercy of the water temperature to regulate critical body functions. Simple functions such as locomotion are affected by water temperature. Goldfish in cool ponds move more slowly than goldfish in very warm ponds. Fancy goldfish in water that is 50 degrees Fahrenheit, are almost catatonic. Their metabolic processes such as digestion, respiration and immune response, are directly tied to the Goldfish water temperature. In situations such as purchasing a goldfish in a store at seventy degrees, to place it in a pond outdoors, with a temperature of forty, it may take days or weeks of careful preparation to avoid a high chance of death. If the water is too cold, there are various heaters and thermostats available for aquariums.
describe the two layers of the pericardium. what is the function of pericardial fluid	The pericardium (from the Greek περί, around and κάρδιον, heart) is a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels. The pericardial sac has two layers, a serous layer and a fibrous layer. It encloses the pericardial cavity which contains pericardial fluid. The pericardium fixes the heart to the mediastinum, gives protection against infection, and provides the lubrication for the heart. In between the parietal and visceral pericardial layers there is a potential space called the pericardial cavity, which contains a supply of lubricating serous fluid known as the pericardial fluid. When the visceral layer comes into contact with heart (not the great vessels) it is known as the epicardium.Surrounding the heart is a fibrous sac called the pericardium. This sac protects the heart, and is actually composed of two layers: an inner visceral one and an outer parietal one. When the heart moves (i.e. when the heart beats), these two layers move with it. For this to happen, it is important that there is no friction between the two layers of the pericardium, which is why pericardial fluid lines the inner space between the them. Much like oil in an engine, the pericardial fluid makes for less friction between the inner and outer layer of the pericardium. The pericardial cavity or sac is the potential space between the parietal and visceral layers of serous pericardium. In other words, two different layers of cardiac tissue.
what materials that can be used to make a suspension bridge	Steel, which is very strong under tension, is an ideal material for cables; a single steel wire, only 0.1 inch thick, can support over half a ton without breaking. Light, and strong, suspension bridges can span distances from 2,000 to 7,000 feet far longer than any other kind of bridge. They are ideal for covering busy waterways. With any bridge project the choice of materials and form usually comes down to cost. Suspension bridges tend to be the most expensive to build. A suspension bridge suspends the roadway from huge main cables, which extend from one end of the bridge to the other. These cables rest on top of high towers and have to be securely anchored into the bank at either end of the bridge.They help keep the cables suspended, and convert the heaviness from the cables into pressure that forces the towers into the ground. They can be made out of iron/steel just like the cables or sometimes stone. For example the Clifton Suspension Bridge towers are made out of Pennant Stone. It is originated from England, Bristol and Wales, and is hard and heavy. It has aesthetic properties as it can be smoothed down to look nice, and has nice colouring. They undergo a lot of tension and compressive forces, and for this they need to be extremely strong. The material used in these cables is steel, it is an alloy of iron, manganese and tungsten, which make it extremely strong, durable and hard. Also tungsten gives it a rather high boiling point too.
how much do early childhood assistant teachers get paid	Salary Outlook. Instructing very young children isn’t as lucrative as teaching preteens or teenagers. A preschool teacher earned a median salary of $27,570 in 2013. The profession’s top salaries were more than $49,660 a year, while the lowest salaries were $18,420 or less. Child day care services tend to employ the most preschool teachers, while elementary and secondary schools tend to pay them the best. Teaching the next generation can be rewarding in an intangible sense, but salary-wise, it’s not the most lucrative social service job. Elementary school teachers ($56,320) and middle school teachers ($56,630) both earned average salaries in 2013 that were higher than preschool teachers, who earned an average of $31,420.As of 2012, these teachers averaged $56,700 in annual pay, and 80 percent earned between $35,700 and $84,440 per year. More than 94 percent worked in elementary schools, where they averaged $56,870 per year. Pay for early childhood education teachers also depends in part on the location of the school. New York state reported the highest pay for preschool teachers in 2012, an average of $40,010 per year, while New Jersey paid the second-highest with an average of $36,820, according to the BLS. They reported an average annual wage of $53,030, and 80 percent earned between $32,450 and $78,230 per year. More than 94 percent of kindergarten teachers worked for elementary schools, where they earned an average of $54,200 annually.
how tall is a bull	A full grown average EBT should be between 18-24. However, there is no height specifics for this breed. AKC breed standards dictate  most stand 21-22 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 50-70 pounds .. A bull terrier smaller than 18 would most likely weigh in the 40's which would be considered small for a standard EBT. Most Standard EBT breeders strive to ensure they reach at least the 20 mark for height within their bloodline. An average 20 male Bull Terrier would weigh around 50 pounds. However, now a days I notice most people prefer males to be in the 60 pound range which require more height than 20.The American Staffordshire bull terrier is a different breed from the Staffordshire bull terrier. Sometimes referred to as an Am Staff, this dog is also sometimes called a pitbull. If the pitbull is actually an Am Staff, a male can stand as tall as 17 to 19 inches, while a female is between 16 and 18 inches. The Am Staff weighs between 57 and 67 pounds. There is a breed called the American pit bull that is not recognized by the AKC but is recognized by 12 other breed clubs. This breed is currently only recognized by five breed clubs. The American bully is a short, stocky dog with a large head and wide chest. This pitbull-type breed reaches a height of 18 to 21 inches in males, 17 to 20 inches in females and a weight of 70 to 120 pounds. There are five categories of American bully according to body type and height and weigh varies greatly
what purpose is served by the production figures squalor reads to the animals	Instead, Squealer tricks them to make them believe that they are treated well and should be happy. The production figures are done for that purpose. Squealer is giving the animals factual data that things are actually better for them than when Jones was in charge. Because the animals have no way to challenge that data, they are persuaded to believe that their perception is incorrect and that Squealer is right. blaky | Student, Grade 11 | eNotes Newbie. Posted on. (Answer #2). squealer wants to persuasive the other animals. On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent as the case might be.”. Squealer is Mr. Propaganda.Posted on. (Answer #1). By Chapter VIII, Napoleon has begun involving the farm in trade with other farms, and as a result he demands much higher production of food from the animals on the farm. During the course of Chapter VIII, Squealer comes to the animals and reads them the production figures. While the figures are informative to the animals, Squealer's purpose in reading them to the animals takes on an added significance. The figures serve as an illustration of the success of the farm/state. They are meant to instill pride and a sense of motivation in the animals, though the opposite it most often the case.

average cost to remodel shower	Remodeling Costs for a Small Bathroom. The cost for a typical small bathroom remodel will range from about $4,000 to $12,000 with the average cost being about $8,000. Let’s look at how the costs breakout starting with the most basic remodel including a new toilet, shower, vanity & sink and tile. The average cost for remodeling a bathroom ranges from around $4,000 to $12,000 for small bathrooms and from about $10,000 to as much as $35,000 for large master bathrooms. Naturally, the cost varies depending on the size of the room, how much you want to have done and the quality of materials selectedThe materials for the average small bathroom remodel will cost between $8,000 and $10,000. This includes new fixtures like a new toilet, new sink, and a new bathtub. It also includes the cost of new tiling, new cupboards, and a countertop for the sink. Cost of Labor. As a general rule, most people expect that the labor for a remodel will cost roughly twice as much as the materials did. This is not a hard and fast rule, but the numbers generally support the claim. On average, a bathroom remodeling job will cost you around twice as much as the materials cost you. For a small bathroom of roughly 100 square feet, labor costs could run an average of $12,000 or $13,000 on the high end. This would include the labor to completely redo tile, completely install new fixtures, complete any necessary wiring and plumbing, and have everything inspected afterward
what is the average cost of a land surveyor	Find out how much your project will cost. Provide a few details about your project and receive competitive quotes from local pros. On average, hiring a land surveyor costs $477 nationally, with most homeowners spending between $334 and $651. This data is based on actual project costs as reported by HomeAdvisor members. One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to find the boundaries of a property. That boundary is described in legal documents and the land surveyor follows that description and locates the boundary on the physical land and marks it, so the owner knows what land he owns. Several factors shape the final bill of a land survey. The cost of hiring a professional surveyor is not so straightforward as paying for routine repair work or even a home inspection. The price varies widely not only by locality and surveyor but also by dozens of project-specific details. Nationally, the average cost to purchase a land survey is about $760 with a range between about $630 and nearly $900. However, these figures may be adjusted by location. Among the most fundamental of cost factors is the project scope; a 1-acre lot will cost less to survey than 2,000 acres. Land surveys are conducted and guaranteed by a licensed professional surveyor. The job involves researching a property's original documentation and physically measuring the land. Surveying provides a clear benefit to owners in both peace of mind and meaningful legal protection.
where are continental climates found	In addition, the location in question must not be semi-arid or arid. Humid continental climates tend to be found above 30° N latitude to 60° N latitude, within the central and northeastern portions of North America, Europe, and Asia. They are much less commonly found in the Southern Hemisphere due to the larger ocean area at that latitude and the consequent greater maritime moderation. A humid continental climate (Koeppen köppen Prefix d and a third letter of a or) b is a climatic region defined By Russian german Climatologist Wladimir koeppen köppen, in 1900 which is typified by large seasonal, temperature differences with warm (to hot and) often humid summers (and cold sometimes) severely. cold wintersThe continental climate has cold winter and hot summer. The difference between summer and winter temperatures can reach 40 °C and even more. The continental type of this climate can be found in the central parts of North America, East Europe and Asia. The other type of the temperate climate is oceanic. It can be found on the West coast of North America, West Europe and the South island of New Zealand. The most famous with its oceanic climate is Great Britain. In the South hemisphere it has limited spreading. It can be found in the southern most parts of South America, Tasmania and the South island of New Zealand. In the conditions of temperate climate we can see, that there are four different seasons – winter, spring, summer and autumn.

the chordate invertebrates have what type of nerve cord	Section 2 • Invertebrate Chordates 803 Chordates are animal s belonging to the phylum Chordata (kor DAH tuh) that have four distinctive features—a dorsal tubular nerve cord, a notochord, pharyngeal pouches, and a postanal tail—at some point during their development. Most chordates are vertebrates. Invertebrate chordates, which belong to two of the subphyla of chordates—Cephalochordata and Urochordata, also have a dorsal tubular nerve cord, a notochord, pharyngeal pouches, a postanal tail, and, possibly, an ancestral thyroid gland. They ha ve no backbone, however.However, unlike echinoderms, chordates are characterized by a notochord, jointed appendages, and segmentation. Four features characterize the chordates and have played an important role in the evolution of the phylum: 1. A single, hollow nerve cord runs just beneath the dorsal surface of the animal. In vertebrates, the dorsal nerve cord differentiates into the brain and spinal cord. 2. A flexible rod, the notochord, forms on the dorsal side of the primitive gut in the early embryo and is present at some developmental stage in all chordates. The notochord is located just below the nerve cord. In lancelets, the notochord runs the entire length of the dorsal nerve cord and persists throughout the animal's life. Characteristics of Vertebrates The evolution of vertebrates involved invasions of sea, land, and air. Vertebrates (subphylum Vertebrata) are chordates with a spinal column.
what doctor to see for autism	Recommend on Facebook Tweet ShareCompartir. Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be difficult, since there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorders. Doctors look at the child’s behavior and development to make a diagnosis. ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger. By age 2, a diagnosis by an experienced professional can be considered very reliable. Developmental screening is a short test to tell if children are learning basic skills when they should, or if they might have delays. During developmental screening the doctor might ask the parent some questions or talk and play with the child during an exam to see how she learns, speaks, behaves, and moves.Symptoms are often apparent by age 2. Many of these symptoms may be hard to pinpoint. They might be confused with personality traits, or with other development issues. That’s why it is essential to see a professional if you suspect your child might suffer from an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a number of different doctors and specialists will play important roles in helping your child with an ASD diagnosis. The Basics of Autism. Autism affects a child’s ability to communicate and develop social skills. Autistic children may seem emotionally detached. According to the Mayo Clinic, they may exhibit obsessive behavior, including intensive preoccupation with a particular object.
what is an object code?	Object code. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Object code, or sometimes an object module, is what a computer compiler produces. In a general sense object code is a sequence of statements or instructions in a computer language, usually a machine code language (i.e., binary) or an intermediate language such as RTL. Object files can in turn be linked to form an executable file or library file. In order to be used, object code must either be placed in an executable file, a library file, or an object file. Object code is a portion of machine code that has not yet been linked into a complete program. It is the machine code for one particular library or module that will make up the completed product.To get from source code to machine language, the programs must be transformed by a compiler. The compiler produces an intermediary form called object code. Object code is often the same as or similar to a computer's machine language. The final step in producing an executable program is to transform the object code into machine language, if it is not already in this form. This can be done by a number of different types of programs, called assemblers, binders, linkers, and loaders. )The code produced by a compiler. Programmers write programs in a form called source code. The source code consists of instructions in a particular language, like C or FORTRAN. Computers, however, can only execute instructions written in a low-level language called

how many roth ira accounts can i have	There's no legal limit to the number of traditional or Roth individual retirement accounts you can open. There is usually a practical limit, however. You can only donate so much to your IRAs each year: Opening 100 Roth accounts doesn't let you save more money than if you had just one. Maximum Contributions. At time of writing the maximum you can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA is $5,500 a year, or $6,500 if you're older than 49. That's not per account; it's the total you can contribute to all your IRA accounts combined. If she only makes $2,000 in self-employment income, you can contribute $5,500 to your account and another $3,500 to her Roth. The Internal Revenue Service discusses income limits and other restrictions on funding spousal IRAs in Publication 590.And you can't put more money than you make in any IRA. So if your income is only $1,500, then $1,500 is the most you can contribute to a Roth. There is an exception that allows Roth accounts for nonworking spouses. If you and your spouse file a joint return but one does not work, the employed spouse can open and contribute to a Roth IRA for the unemployed partner. Many taxpayers, however, find that a Roth works best for them. With a Roth account, you won't get an immediate tax break, but you won't pay any tax on your money when you eventually take it out. The IRS, however, has specific rules on just who can have a Roth IRA and how much money can be contributed each year.

what is tricare and who is eligible	TRICARE is a health benefit program for all seven uniformed services: the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To use TRICARE, you must be listed in DEERS as being eligible for military health care benefits. If you don't find answers to your eligibility questions in this section, check with your military service personnel office for specific information. TRICARE-eligible persons include the following: 1  Active duty service members. 1 TRICARE eligibility is effective July 1, 1994, if a court of law places the child. 2  A child placed by a recognized adoption agency is eligible effective October 5, 1994. 3  Children of current or former service members or their spouses born out of wedlock may be eligible for TRICARE benefits under certain conditions.First, let’s look at what is meant by the terms TRICARE and TRICARE for Life (TFL). 1  TRICARE is the basic health care program serving Uniformed Service members, retirees and their families worldwide who, under law, are enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). 1 DEERS is a database of uniformed service members and their eligible family members maintained by the Department of Defense. 2  TRICARE for Life (TFL) is TRICARE’s version of a Medicare supplemental plan. 3  It’s commonly referred to as Medicare-wraparound coverage for Medicare-eligible TRICARE beneficiaries.
how do you determine wages and salary levels for your employees	For instance, an employee hired for a manager-in-training position may be on a pay scale that reflects salary increases for completing incremental training components. A newly hired manager-in-training might earn $55,000 as a starting salary. Step 4. Use information from public-sector job databases. The federal government compensation structure is edging toward becoming more competitive with private-sector employment. This means the salary levels used to recruit federal government workers may be helpful in constructing a pay scale for your employees. Step 5. Obtain historical pay scales for your employees. Review the wages to determine for currency and adjust the scales based on cost of living increases and market conditions. For example, if your pay scale in 2002 for registered nurses indicates starting wages at $50,000, factor in salary changes due to anticipated labor shortages in this occupation1 Since many employers adjust for inflation each year, maintaining competitive pay may, in fact, require you to adjust every 12 to 18 months. 2  Mobility of the workforce. 3  As the educational level of your employees rises, more will change jobs and change employers more frequently. 1 Without wage and salary data, it's impossible to know that you offer pay that is fair in relation to other employers. 2  If your employees begin to feel underpaid, you won't be able to tell them, with confidence, that they're not. 3  Threat of unionization.

which muscle controls the flow of blood into the skin capillary	Muscular, or distributing, arteries deliver blood to specific body organs, and have the greatest proportion of tunica media of all vessels, making them more active in vasoconstriction. Arterioles are the smallest arteries and regulate blood flow into capillary beds through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Capillaries are the smallest vessels and allow for exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Continuous capillaries are most common and allow passage of fluids and small solutes. Fenestrated capillaries are more permeable to fluids and solutes than continuous capillaries. Sinusoidal capillaries are leaky capillaries that allow large molecules to pass between the blood and surrounding tissues. Capillary beds are microcirculatory networks consisting of a vascular shunt and true capillaries, which function as the exchange vessels.1 Blood is carried in a closed system of vessels that begins and ends at the heart. 2  The three major types of vessels are arteries, capillaries, and veins. 3  Arteries carry blood away from the heart, veins carry blood toward the heart. 4  Capillaries contact tissue cells and directly serve cellular needs. 1 At the arterial end of a bed, __________ forces dominate (fluids flow 2  ___). At the venous end of a bed, _______ forces dominate (fluids flow 3  ___). More fluids enter the tissue beds than return blood, and the excess fluid is returned to the blood via the _________ _______.

where does carbon dioxide enter the blood	Additionally, hydrogen ion produced along with bicarbonate causes oxygen to be released from hemoglobin in our tissues. The opposite occurs in our lungs. As blood flows through the lungs, bicarbonate enters the red blood cell, where it is converted into carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide then diffuses out of the red blood cell and into the lungs, where it is expired. In summary, carbon dioxide is a metabolic waste product of ATP synthesis. As our cells produce carbon dioxide, it diffuses into the blood, where it is transported to the lungs for expiration. Some of the carbon dioxide is transported dissolved in the plasma. Some carbon dioxide is transported as carbaminohemoglobin. However, most carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate. As blood flows through the tissues, carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells, where it is converted into bicarbonateIt is then exhaled back into the atmosphere. Oxygen diffuses from the blood/tissue fluid into cells where it is used in respiration to release energy. Carbon dioxide diffuses back into the blood from cells as it is a waste product made during respiration. Source(s): AS biology student. Elfsong · 7 years ago. For O2 it is denoted as pO2 and pCO2 for carbon dioxide. CO2 diffuses out through the venous blood into the lungs (via alveoli) due to concentration gradient. Similarly pO2 which is high in concentration in the alveoli coming from outside the blood capillaries diffuses into lungs.
what should the calorie intake be for a woman	Weight Loss. The minimum a woman should consume daily is 1,200 calories, according to Medline Plus. One pound of fat equals about 3,500 calories. To lose one pound a week, a woman should reduce her calories or increase her physical activity by 500 calories a day. To lose two pounds a week, a deficit of 1,000 calories is needed. For women, those aged 19 to 25 are allowed the most calories on this chart, ranging from 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day depending on activity level. Sedentary women ages 51 and older should consume the least amount, at 1,600 a day.According to the What We Eat in America report for 2009 to 2010, a woman's average daily caloric intake changes at different stages of life. In her twenties, she takes in about 1,949 calories a day, which is the highest caloric intake level of her lifetime, and this decreases to 1,831 in her thirties. Throughout her forties, her average caloric intake is 1,794 and in her fifties, it is 1,759. During her sixties, she eats about 1,717 calories per day and that number decreases to about 1,535 for women ages 70 and up. A moderately active woman needs about 2,200 calories a day up to age 25. Then, until she reaches age 50, she should get 2,000 calories a day and taper down to 1,800 calories a day from age 51 on. Sedentary women ages 19 to 25 need 2,000 calories a day; sedentary women ages 26 to 50 need 1,800 calories a day and sedentary women ages 51 and over need 1,600 calories a day
how long can you keep fresh frozen pork in the freezer	Sealed, pre-packed fresh pork cuts can be kept in the refrigerator 2 to 4 days; sealed ground pork will keep in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. If you do plan on keeping the raw, fresh pork longer than 2 to 3 days before cooking it, store it well-wrapped in the freezer. How long can I store ham or other smoked products in the refrigerator?

where does the word pumpernickel come from	Pumpernickel (English pronunciation: /ˈpʌmpərnɪkəl/ ; [ˈpʊmpɐˌnɪkəl]) is a typically heavy, slightly sweet rye bread traditionally made with coarsely ground rye. It is often made with a combination of rye flour and whole rye berries. At one time it was traditional peasant fare, but largely during the 20th century various forms became popular through delicatessens and supermarkets. Hence, pumpernickel is described as the devil's fart, a definition accepted by the Snopes International Language Database, the publisher Random House, and by some English language dictionaries, including the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The American Heritage Dictionary adds so named from being hard to digest.Westphalia is a State in Germany. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

Etymology : Like many german words they put two or three together to make a new word. More about Rye. However Rye has very little gluten so it is very hard to get any structure in your bread, and even shape it. Very few breads are made only with Rye flour. The Traditional Pumpernickel is made from only coarse rye grains and dark rye flour, which is coarse ground rye. A substantial starter is needed so a sourdough taking a few days to rev up is used. Pumpernickel made the Westphalian way is baked for 16 to 20 hours in a steam oven

do some probiotics contain milk	Lactose free products are NOT the same as dairy free products. If an acidophilus supplement is called lactose free it means it does not contain any milk sugar, but it may contain isolated, lactose-free milk protein-so it would NOT be dairy free. Differences that can effect your health. A dairy free probiotic means it does not contain either lactose (milk sugars) or milk proteins. So really-the term milk-free' does not really define your needs sufficiently. You need to know if you require dairy free or lactose free. Dairy free is a more encompassing state than simply one not containing lactose. Turtle Mountain's So Delicous dairy free milk does not contain probiotics although they are dairy and lactose free. However the So Delicous soy yogurts and coconut milk yogurts do contain live cultures but they do not contain L. acidophilus. Shame because they sound delicous!You can also incorporate probiotics into your diet through dairy-free foods. Yogurt and kefir contain live probiotic cultures, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, but dairy-free versions of yogurt and kefir made from almond, soy or coconut milk and can be found at your local supermarket and health food store. Probiotics are good bacteria that help balance bacteria in the colon and can boost overall gastrointestinal health. Probiotics can be taken as supplements and are found naturally in certain foods. If you follow a dairy-free diet, you can still take probiotics.
what is the symbolism of horus in a dream	The Eye of Horus is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection, royal power and good health. The eye is personified in the goddess Wadjet (also written as Wedjat, or  Udjat , Uadjet, Wedjoyet, Edjo or Uto). It is also known as ' 'The Eye of Ra' '. The name Wadjet is derived from wadj meaning green, hence the green one, and was known to the Greeks and Romans as uraeus from the Egyptian iaret meaning risen one from the image of a cobra rising up in protection.It's a symbol of the Sun, and it was also called eye of Ra (by the Egyprian Sun god, Ra). The falcon's lef … t eye represents the Moon.   Answer   The Eye of Horus, healed by Thoth, was an amulet, or magic charm. The Ancient Egyptians also used it to describe fractions. The Egyptians sometimes had had two eye symbols, with the left eye being the Eye of Horus, symbolising the moon, and the right eye being symbolising the Eye of Ra, or the sun. The Eye of Horus is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection. The symbol is seen on images of Horus' mother, Hathor, and on other deities associated with her. The ancients believed this symbol of indestructibility would assist in rebirth. Thus, funerary amulets were often made in the shape of the Eye of Horus. It sybolizes everything it would symbolize outside of a Dream. You want protection and are possibly feeling intimidated, scared. When we dream of distinct symbols it's usually the subconscious in our minds trying to tell us something.
how many Palestinians have been killed	Since January 2005, when the conflict began to change dramatically, it has killed 4,006 people, of whom 168 have been Israeli and 3,838 Palestinian. That means that, since January 2005, only four percent of those killed have been Israeli, and 96 percent Palestinian. Since January 2005, in other words, the conflict has killed 23 Palestinians for every one Israeli it claims. Still, even though Israelis are killed at a far lower rate than are Palestinians, that does not make Israeli deaths any less real or traumatic. That number is even more staggering when you consider that there are about twice as many Israelis as there are Palestinians. This means, very roughly, that a Palestinian person has been 15 times more likely to be killed by the conflict than an Israeli person.The numbers in this chart include civilians and combatants killed by members of the opposing nationality (and therefore, do not include Palestinians killed by an explosive device that they set or was on their person, Israelis killed in 'friendly fire' incidents, etc.). We do not doubt the reliability of their data, and only use B'Tselem's more conservative numbers because they collect data on both populations. In the past we used the statistics provided by Israel’s military for the number of Israelis killed, but they have not updated their statistics page since early in 2006. In addition, there is reason to believe that their numbers may have been somewhat inflated
how does overpopulation affect US CITIZENS	Malthus states that population increase is detrimental to a nation’s economy due to a variety of problems caused by the growth. For example, overpopulation and population growth places a tremendous amount of pressure on natural resources, which result in a chain reaction of problems as the nation grows. The increase in demand for food leads to a decrease in natural resources, which are needed for a nation to survive. Other negative effects of population growth and, specifically, overpopulation include poverty caused by low income per capita, famine, and disease. India is a prime example of Thomas Malthus’ theory of population growth and its effect on the economy. India is a country plagued by poverty primarily caused by overpopulation. Inhabited by over nine hundred billion people, India has a population of three hundred million under the poverty lineBy the 1970s, American women were averaging fewer babies and the US was well-positioned to transition from a growing to a stable population. Without post- 1970 immigration, the U.S. population would have leveled off below 250 million in the first few decades of this century. Foreign-born residents are now 40% of the total of the population, according to new United States Census Bureau figures. In 1990, foreign-born residents were only 28%. The new figures come from a 15,417-household survey taken in 1999 by the Census Bureau. Without immigration, NYC's population would be shrinking.

cost of real hgh	When you are diagnosed and prescribed HGH, the cost may be affordable. The average price of HGH therapy can range from $300 to $1,000 to per month for growth hormone treatments and from about $150 to $500 per month for testosterone injections. Many patients may decide to take HGH alone and the results can still be fantastic. Injectable HGH Cost can vary.

As mentioned earlier, most people will use two vials per month. Prices for injectable HGH vary widely and range from $76 per dose to as high as $300 per dose. At $76 per dose you're looking at $1800 per year, plus the blood tests plus the doctor's office visits. At the higher $300 dosage cost you're looking at a whopping $7200 plus additional fees. So, in the end, the answer to the question What are the real costs of injectable HGH? seems to be anywhere from nearly $5,000 per year up to as much as $10,000 or more. Is it worth it? The average patient uses two vials of HGH per month which requires two office visits per month and two injections. Again, the actual costs of these visits and injections can range from $50 to $150 and higher.

what are the steps of the water cycle	Evaporation: Heat from the Sun causes water on Earth (in oceans, lakes etc) to evaporate (turn from liquid into gas) and rise into the sky. This water vapor collects in the sky in the form of clouds. Condensation: As water vapor in the clouds cools down it becomes water again, this process is called condensation. Precipitation: Water falls from the sky in the form of rain, snow, hail, or sleet, this process is called precipitation. Collection: Oceans and lakes collect water that has fallen. Water evaporates into the sky again and the cycle continues.The Water Cycle More than ninety percent of the Earth's water is locked beneath its surface either in crystal rocks or deep in the interior and does not take part in the water cycle. A large portion of the water that does participate in the water cycle comes from the Earth's oceans. Step 1: A large quantity of water evaporates from the surface of the ocean. Evaporation is the conversion of liquid water to a gaseous form of water called water vapor. Step 2: The water vapor then condenses to form clouds. Most of this condensed water will then precipitate back into the ocean, but some will travel on and eventually float over land. Precipitate means to condense from a vapor and fall as rain or snow. Step 3: The condensed water (clouds) that floats over land picks up more water vapor from evaporation and transpiration. Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants.
what is a good naturalistic observation	Naturalistic observation is a type of research method that scientists use to collect data and information about different types of things. What it means is that the subject(s) are observed, unknowingly, in their natural environment. Important Facts About Naturalistic Observation. 1  The exact opposite of naturalistic observation is called analog observation. 2  The three steps of naturalistic observation are description, prediction, and explanation. 3  This form of observation requires the most meticulous note taking and in depth researcher involvement. 4  The real world data that is ...Modified: 2013-12-28 Naturalistic observation is probably the basis for all other psychological research methods. Scientists must first observe the world before they can formulate hypotheses. Yet, even the simple process of observing is not that simple when it is used as a method of study. In principle, one can conduct naturalistic observation nearly anywhere. There are some exceptions, however, for example, the naturalistic observation of human sexual behavior, or the observation of juries. You cannot observe a jury unless you happen to be one of the jurors. Naturalistic observation is probably the best method around for the process of formulating new hypotheses. By becoming intimately familiar with subjects and their behavior, one can start to make hypotheses about them and their behavior. Those hypotheses can then be tested by other methods.

what type of glass is prosecco served in	A bottle of Prosecco di Conegliano spumante extra dry and a glass of Prosecco frizzante, which stops forming bubbles soon after pouring. Prosecco /prɵˈsɛkoʊ/ (. [proˈsekko]) is an Italian white wine. Prosecco DOC can be Spumante sparkling wine, Frizzante (semi-sparkling) and Tranquillo (still) depending on the perlage. It is made from Glera grapes, formerly known also as Prosecco, but other grape varieties may be included. The following varieties are traditionally used with Glera up to a maximum of 15% of the total: Verdiso, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Perera, Glera lunga, Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco, Pinot Grigio and Pinot Nero. The first known mention of the name Prosecco is attributed to the Englishman Fynes Moryson, who, visiting the north of Italy in 1593, notes:  Histria is devided into Forum Julii, and Histria properly so called... Here growes the wine Pucinum, now called Prosecho, much celebrated by Pliny.The Consortium recommends serving Prosecco in a tulip-shaped Prosecco glass, rather than the flutes and coupes typically used to serve champagne. This type of glass allows the drinker to experience in full the Prosecco’s aromas. Prosecco bottles should be stored upright in a cool, dark place (around 10-15⁰C) and kept away from sources of light or heat. For optimum enjoyment, Prosecco should be chilled to around 6-8⁰C before drinking, although the precise temperature will depend on the style of the wine. See Types of Prosecco.
how do hotspots work for wifi	A Wi-Fi hotspot works much the same as the Wi-Fi you find in most homes. A wireless access point communicates with computers and other Wi-Fi devices using radio signals. This Wi-Fi access point is connected to the Internet and is usually connected to a router or a server that regulates who can access the Wi-Fi. How the signals are sent and received is standardized, using the 80211 standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Many places offer free Wi-Fi hotspots as a public service, including airports, libraries, college campuses and other public locations. Restaurants, coffee shops and hotels may offer free Wi-Fi hotspots to attract customers. Other hotspots require that you pay for using the service. The cost of paid hotspots varies. Some places require that you pay with a credit card, or charge the service to your smartphone carrier accountWiFi Hotspots. A WiFi hotspot is simply an area with an accessible wireless network. The term is most often used to refer to wireless networks in public areas like airports and coffee shops. Some are free and some require fees for use, but in either case they can be handy when you are on the go. This means that when you turn your computer on in a WiFi hotspot, the computer will inform you that the network exists and ask whether you want to connect to it. If you have an older computer, you may need to use a software program to detect and connect to a

how much does it cost to update a small bathroom	Typical Hourly Rate = $50-$75 per hour. When you are remodeling a small bathroom, you need to make sure that your costs are always in the forefront of your mind. Using this guide, you will be able to develop a reasonably accurate estimate of how much a small bathroom remodel costs. Cost of Labor.

On average, a bathroom remodeling job will cost you around twice as much as the materials cost you. For a small bathroom of roughly 100 square feet, labor costs could run an average of $12,000 or $13,000 on the high end. This would include the labor to completely redo tile, completely install new fixtures, complete any necessary wiring and plumbing, and have everything inspected afterward1 The above figures place the bathroom update at $250 per square foot. 2  This pricing structure assumes that carpenters charge an average of $70 per hour, electricians between $65 to $85 per hour, painters between $20 and $35 per hour and plumbers between $45 and $65 per hour. 1 Polished nickel faucets-Average cost is $400 each plus four hours of installation; 2  Install ceramic tile floor-Average of 884 tiles to be installed for the 120 square feet. 3  Standard prices for installation are between $11 to $22 per square foot for a total of roughly $1320;
what is a settlor trust	In law a settlor is a person who settles property on trust law for the benefit of beneficiaries. In some legal systems, a settlor is also referred to as a trustor, or occasionally, a grantor or donor. Where the trust is a testamentary trust, the settlor is usually referred to as the testator.

For example, if a mother decides to create a trust and names her daughter as the trustee, the mother is the settlor but not the trustee. It is common, however, for the settlor to serve as the trustee. There can be more than one settlor and more than one trustee. Revoking and Modifying the Trust. The power to revoke or modify a trust is almost always reserved for the settlor, as it is the settlor who created the trust and the settlor’s property that is held by the trust.

is anemia a disease	Anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated.Anemia of chronic disease is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying disorders including chronic illnesses such as cancer, certain infections, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Researchers have also learned that individuals with anemia of chronic disease also have an imbalance in the distribution of iron in the body and as a result cannot effectively use iron to create new blood cells despite having sufficient or elevated levels of iron stored in the tissues.
which resort is better for kids las cabos or puerto vallarta	We found more aggressive vendors in Cabo than PV. The Caribbean side of Mexico; Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Riveria Maya aream has great white sandy beaches and clear water perfect for swimming. I've never been to Cabo, but something else to consider is PV is farther south and the water is warm enough to go in year round. I'm not sure if that's the case in Cabo. Also, I would say the farther you get from downtown in Puerto Vallarta, the better the beaches and water get. If you go to some of the surrounding beaches like Yelapa or take a trip to Los Arcos and the Marietas, the water is very clear (particularly the Marietas) as long as the tide is not too stroIt really depends on what you are looking for. Cabo and Cancun are more expensive than PV. Cancun has the best beach. Nightlife is good in all three. Cancun more for the younger, spring break crowd. PV has the best Old Town area with authentic Mexican hotels and shopping. Its very old-world Mexico. There is lots of history and a ton of things to do like jungle tours and fishing then its perfect. Puerto Vallarta and Cabo are both more adult oriented locations. Yes, children are welcome in most places but these destinations are better suited for people over 18. In Cabo I'd recommend the Riu Cabo San Lucas or Dreams Los Cabos. For Puerto Vallarta, either Dreams Puerto Vallarta, the Marival Resort or the Palladium Vallarta. Now, as for Cancun/ Riviera Maya you have more options

what temperature do snakes eggs become female	Egg requirements fall mostly into two categories: temperature and humidity. And for most species of python eggs, the requirements are identical: a temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit combined with high humidity. Nearly every python egg has been hatched by the female that laid it. Female pythons are good mothers and have been programmed by millions of years of evolution to do one thing: make baby pythons! Female pythons of different species have varying control over both temperature and humidity. The female, however, only has the ability to raise the temperature of the eggs. She can’t lower it. If the ambient temperature is already set at 90 degrees, then she no longer has any control over temperature. The female can either conserve or release the moisture generated by egg incubation.Corn Snake Eggs in Damp Vermiculite. Incubate the eggs until they hatch. The incubation to hatch time varies depending on the incubation temperature. It's recommended that corn snake eggs be incubated at 78-84 degrees F (recommended temperature is 82 degrees F). If they are incubated at 82 degrees, the eggs will take about 58-62 days to hatch. The eggs can be incubated in a commercial incubator, but an incubator isn't necessarily needed. Egg Incubation. After the female corn snake has laid her eggs, gently remove them from her egg laying box. Keep them in the same orientation as they were laid. Place them in an incubation container with a lid.
what is a body organ provide an example	In biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function. In anatomy, a viscus /ˈvɪskəs/ is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form. Organs are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and sporadic tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Two or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus.Tissues are further organized in organs, the third level of organization in living things. Organs are groups of different tissues that work together. Your heart, for example, is an organ made up of muscle tissue, blood tissue, and nerve tissue. You are probably familiar with the names of many of the body organs. The brain, stomach, kidneys, and skin are some examples. Like cells and tissues, organs seldom work alone. They cooperate with one another and form specific organ systems. Organ systems are the fourth level of organization in living things. An organ system is a group of organs working together to perform a specific function for the organism.

Mutualism is the way two organisms of different species exist in a relationship in which each individual benefits from the activity of the other. Similar interactions within a species are known as co-operation. Mutualism can be contrasted with interspecific competition, in which each species experiences reduced fitness, and exploitation, or parasitism, in which one species benefits at the expense of the other. Mutualism is a type of symbiosis. A well-known example of mutualism is the relationship between ungulates (such as bovines) and bacteria within their intestines. The ungulates benefit from the cellulase produced by the bacteria, which facilitates digestion; the bacteria benefit from having a stable supply of nutrients in the host environment.In many cases, both species benefit from the interaction. This type of symbiosis is called mutualism. An example of mutualism is the relationship between bullhorn acacia trees and certain species of ants. Let's review. In biology, symbiosis refers to a close, long-term interaction between two different species. But, there are many different types of symbiotic relationships. Mutualism is a type of symbiosis where both species benefit from the interaction. An example of mutualism is the relationship between bullhorn acacia trees and certain species of ants. The acacia provides food and shelter for the ants and the ants protect the tree
what is pumice	Pumice /ˈpʌmɨs/ , called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser. Pumice is created when super-heated, highly pressurized rock is violently ejected from a volcano. The unusual foamy configuration of pumice happens because of simultaneous rapid cooling and rapid depressurization. It is commonly, but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, phonolite, trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known. Pumice is commonly pale in color, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, to green-brown or black.Pumice is a light-colored, extremely porous igneous rock that forms during explosive volcanic eruptions. It is used as aggregate in lightweight concrete, as landscaping aggregate, and as an abrasive in a variety of industrial and consumer products. The vesicles are actually gas bubbles that were trapped in the rock during the rapid cooling of a gas-rich frothy magma. The material cools so quickly that atoms in the melt are not able to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure. Thus, pumice is an amorphous volcanic glass known as a  mineraloid .
what is the recommended amount of water to drink daily	Learn how much water you should drink every day. You need half of your body weight in ounces of water daily. This is the number most individuals recognize and aspire to for their daily water intake. A good rule for drinking the right amount of water is to drink one glass of water each hour. An average person should drink this amount of water daily. It is the recommended daily water intake amount to drink 12 glasses of water. If you drink alcohol, you should drink at least an equal amount of water. Drinking a good amount of water could lower your risks of a heart attackHealth experts say that the average person should drink eight 8-ounce (236.6-mL) glasses of water daily. Exactly how much water you should drink each day can depend on how big you are, however. Some healthcare professionals recommend drinking half an ounce (14.8 mL) per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body weight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), you should drink 75 ounces (2.2 liters) of water daily. Other factors that can affect how much water you should drink daily include your physical activity level, the climate where you live, your diet and certain other health or medical factors. I drink 150-180 ounces of water a day, about 1.25 gallons. But I train for mixed martial arts, so I need a lot of water. Drinking water is one of the healthiest things you can consume daily. If you don't like it, I suggest you stop drinking the soda and learn to like water.
at what age can chickens start layer feed	LAYER FEED, 18 weeks and older (The Big Girls). Layer feed is available in mash, crumble and pellet forms, all of which describe the size of the feed. Mash is the smallest, pellets, the largest. Layer feed contains 16-18% protein and has added calcium, which is necessary for eggshell production. Laying hens can be fed layer ration as early as 18 weeks or as late as the arrival of their first egg, but should not be fed to birds younger than 18 weeks old. Most new chicken-keepers wonder at what age a chick can be given treats, but there is no specific age at which it is appropriate. Chicks are tiny and treats will replace a percentage of the nutrition in starter ration that their rapidly-growing bodies require.If you’re raising layer hens: From when your chicks hatch until six weeks of age, feed your chicks a starter feed that has a protein level of 20-22 percent. Once the chicks hit six weeks of age, feed them pullet grower (14 to 16 percent protein) until age 20 weeks. After that, switch your hens to layer feed with a protein level of 15 to 18 percent. (MONEY-SAVING SECRET: Layer feed is often expensive. It can be costly, to both your budget and your chickens’ health! The University of California-Davis recommends the following for feeding layer hens: 1  Chick starter: 2 to 2.9 lbs. 2  per chick for the first six weeks. 3  Pullet grower: 12 to 13 lbs. 4  per pullet for approximately 14 weeks. 5  Layer feed: 1.8 to 2.4 lbs.

where were the terracotta army discovered	The Terracotta Army was discovered on 29 March 1974 to the east of Xi'an in Shaanxi province by farmers digging a water well approximately 1.6 kilometres (0.99 mi) east of the Qin Emperor's tomb mound at Mount Li (Lishan), a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses. The Terracotta Army has been described as the only other set of historic artifacts (along with the remnants of wreck of the RMS Titanic) that can draw a crowd by the name alone. Warriors and other artifacts were exhibited to the public at the Forum de Barcelona in Barcelona between 9 May and 26 September 2004.The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits nearby Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum.

frequency of pertussis vaccine adults	1 FACT: A booster vaccine for adolescents and adults, known as Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis), protects against pertussis or “whooping cough.”. 2  FACT: The CDC recommends that adults receive a single dose of Tdap in place of one Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster, which is recommended every 10 years for adults. Prevention. Whooping cough is most contagious before the coughing starts, so the most effective way to prevent it is through immunization. The whooping cough booster vaccine for adults (and adolescents) is called Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis). Younger children get a different formulation, called DTaP. Both protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussiTd is a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine given to adolescents and adults as a booster shot every 10 years, or after an exposure to tetanus under some circumstances. Tdap is similar to Td but also containing protection against pertussis. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks. In the U.S., DTaP, Tdap, and Td vaccines are most commonly used. One of these (DTaP) is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and two (Tdap and Td) are given to older children and adults.
director and officer definition	Anyone who serves as a director or an officer of a for-profit business or nonprofit organization may be at risk of a personal claim as a result of that position. A directors and officers liability policy insures them against personal losses. It can also help reimburse the business or nonprofit for the legal fees or other costs it may incur in defending those individuals against a lawsuit. The policies are generally purchased by the organization to cover a group of individuals rather than by the individuals themselves. Policies can be written to insure against a variety of hazards, but they generally make exclusions for fraud or other criminal activity.Such coverage can extend to defence costs arising out of criminal and regulatory investigations/trials as well; in fact, often civil and criminal actions are brought against directors/officers simultaneously. Intentional illegal acts, however, are typically not covered under D&O policies. It has become closely associated with broader management liability insurance, which covers liabilities of the corporation itself as well as the personal liabilities for the directors and officers of the corporation. The insurance is closely related to corporate governance, corporations law, and the fiduciary duty owed to shareholders or other beneficiaries. Under the United States business judgment rule, the directors and officers are granted broad discretion in their business activities.
where did fgm originate	Female Genital Mutilation can also be called Female Genital Cutting or Female Circumcision.Although the practice predates the birth of Islam, it has taken on a dimension of the religion. 1 Sunna Circumcision (Type I)- The tip of a woman's clitoris is shaved or cut off. 2  The word sunna refers to Muhammed's early tradition of the practice. 3  This form of Female Genital Mutilation can be found in many countries in both East and West Africa, and countries in the Middle East.Female genital mutilation may be practiced in different cultures and religions, however, it is not supported by the written word or history of any of the participants. For example, in East Africa, where the strongest concentration of population in the world that practices FGM is located, has a strong Muslim basis. In the Muslim culture there are two main sources of law, and. , neither of which make any reference to FGM and therefore can not advocate it either. She is one of the 6,000 girls genitally mutilated daily in East Africa and to date,114 million women have already experienced this mutilation in East Africa alone (Dorkenoo 1994, p123). Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) originally began in Egypt as a type of ceremony for young women entering puberty. The ancient Egyptians practiced a form of FGM called infibulation, also known as Pharaonic Circumcision.. The Romans populated much of Egypt at this time and the term infibulation originated with them
what is an artery	The pulmonary artery carries blood from the heart to the lungs, where it receives oxygen. It is unique because the blood in it is not oxygenated, as it has not yet passed through the lungs. The other unique artery is the umbilical artery, which carries deoxygenated blood from a fetus to its mother]. Arteries have a higher blood pressure than other parts of the circulatory system. The pressure in arteries varies during the cardiac cycle. It is highest when the heart contracts and lowest when heart relaxes. While most arteries carry oxygenated blood, there are two exceptions to this, the pulmonary and the umbilical arteries. The effective arterial blood volume is that extracellular fluid which fills the arterial system. The circulatory system is vital for sustaining life.An artery is an elastic blood vessel that transports blood away from the heart. There are two main types of arteries: pulmonary arteries and systemic arteries. Pulmonary arteries carry blood from the heart to the lungs where the blood picks up oxygen. The oxygen rich blood is then returned to the heart via the pulmonary veins. Systemic arteries deliver blood to the rest of the body. The aorta is the main systemic artery and the largest artery of the body. It originates from the heart and branches out into smaller arteries which supply blood to the head region (brachiocephalic artery), the heart itself (coronary arteries), and the lower regions of the body
is bun acidic or alkalotic	For example, an increase in the anion gap can indicate diabetic ketoacidosis. (For more on anion gap, see Common Questions #1 here .). People with a metabolic alkalosis usually have low chloride (Cl -) and potassium (K +) values, which again provides clues as to the cause of the acid-base disturbance.Based on these results, other tests may be ordered to diagnose the disease or condition that is producing the acidosis or alkalosis.or example, an increase in the anion gap can indicate diabetic ketoacidosis. (For more on anion gap, see Common Questions #1 here .). People with a metabolic alkalosis usually have low chloride (Cl -) and potassium (K +) values, which again provides clues as to the cause of the acid-base disturbance.ABGs also measure base excess/base deficit (BE/BD), which is the best indicator of the degree of acidosis/alkalosis. BE/BD is measured by gauging the amount of acid or base that is required to titrate the patient's blood sample to a pH of 7.40, given a PCO 2 level of 40 mm Hg at 37 degrees Celsius.BE/BD is a more accurate reflection of the body's state, and it is recommended over calculations using the HCO 3 level.actic acidosis and other forms of organic acidosis generally do not present with a significant potassium shift. Glucose level is commonly elevated in DKA, and it may be low, normal, or mildly elevated in alcoholic ketoacidosis. The BUN and creatinine levels are elevated in uremic acidosis.
per diem nba	Many overlook the per diem issued to pro athletes considering their salaries dwarf the norm. But it, too, has been on a steady rise, clearly reflecting the evolution that's in play. Everything has changed, Proski said. Last season, the per diem in the NBA was $124. Next season's amount hasn't been decided, but it will be slightly higher. When Proski broke into the league in 1967 as a trainer with the Chicago Bulls, he recalls an $8 stipend for staff and players. Now you can't get a hot dog for seven or eight bucks, he said. But in the NBA, that bond hasn't seemed to deteriorate as the players got richer. Previous Suns stars such as Danny Manning, Jason Kidd, Dan Majerle and Kevin Johnson were known to pass off their per diem cash to athletic trainers or equipment managers.Per Diem-What It Is. Part of the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, each NBA player receives $106 US for every day they are on the road. It serves as their meal money-roughly $19 for breakfast, $30 for lunch and $57 for dinner. Not a bad deal, considering $106 can easily feed a family of five for a week! The $106 a day is a nice raise from the original per diem. In 1957 the NBA's per diem was $7 a day. Per Diem-How Others Spend it. 1  Antonio Davis-This former NBA big man was making around $9 million a year in his last years in the NBA. 2  Marcus Camby-This Denver Nuggets center gives some of his per diem to younger, less-payed players on his team.
what contains edta	EDTA is also used intramuscularly for lead poisoning and related brain damage. EDTA is sometimes used as an ointment for skin irritations produced by metals such as chromium, nickel, and copper. Eye drops containing EDTA are used to treat calcium deposits in the eye. In foods, EDTA bound to iron is used to “fortify” grain-based products such as breakfast cereals and cereal bars. EDTA is also used in calcium and sodium compounds to preserve food; and to promote the color, texture, and flavor of food. INTRAMUSCULAR 1  : For calcium deposits on the cornea of the eye: Healthcare providers use EDTA as part of a procedure. 2  For lead poisoning and also for high levels of calcium in the blood: Healthcare providers give EDTA intravenously (by IV). 3  For lead poisoning: Healthcare providers give EDTA in a shot (by injection).EDTA is a chemical that binds and holds on to (chelates) minerals and metals such as chromium, iron, lead, mercury, copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, calcium, cobalt, manganese, and magnesium. When they are bound, they can't have any effects on the body and they are removed from the body.

what causes bladder pains	Some common causes of bladder spasms are: 1  Urinary tract infection (UTI): Bladder pain and burning are a common symptom of a UTI. 2  Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called painful bladder syndrome: This condition refers to bladder and urinary pain that is not due to other causes, such as a urinary tract infection.ome common causes of bladder spasms are: 1  Urinary tract infection (UTI): Bladder pain and burning are a common symptom of a UTI. 2  Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called painful bladder syndrome: This condition refers to bladder and urinary pain that is not due to other causes, such as a urinary tract infection.Bladder pain may be the result of multiple factors, including infection, disease or injury to the bladder. Symptoms may arise if you experience problems with normal bladder function, such as difficulty urinating, increased frequency of urination, or painful urination.Bladder pain can involve other regions of the body if it is caused by cancers, endometriosis, or bowel disorders.These conditions can lead to bladder damage, and their symptoms may include bloody urine, fever, or pain in the lower back, abdomen or side.ladder pain that is associated with a serious medical condition, such as cancer, may have long-term and even life-threatening complications. Further, bladder pain that is associated with an acute bladder infection could lead to a more serious complication, such as widespread infection.
what does burning incense symbolize	In Revelation 8:3-4 an angel holding a gold censer is given a great quantity of incense to offer and the smoke of the incense goes up before God with prayers. So, among Christians today, incense has ritual and symbolic meaning. Its sweet aroma symbolizes something pleasing and acceptable being offered to God. Burning incense is also a sign of reverence and dedication. Incensing the body at a funeral Mass is a sign of reverence for the body that was once the temple of God. The rising smoke came to symbolize a person's or people's prayers rising up to God. So in Psalm 141 we have the plea, Let my prayer come like incense before you.. Early Christians also found symbolic meaning in the use of incense. In the Book of Revelation, for instance, John has a vision of heaven and a kind of heavenly liturgy where the 24 elders worship the lamb that was slainThe incense is also used to burn a Buddhist monk or nun's scalp during ordination and the burning usually lasts for 5 minutes, produces 6, 9 or 12 circular scars (called jieba or ordination scars) on the person's scalp after the person has suffered great pain from the burning. Incense use in religious ritual was either further or simultaneously developed in China, and eventually transmitted to Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. Incense holds an invaluable role in East Asian Buddhist ceremonies and rites as well as in those of Chinese Taoist and Japanese Shinto shrines.
difference between a nurse anesthetist and an anesthesiologist	A nurse anesthetist or CRNA for short (certified registered nurse anesthetist) is a registered nurse that worked in a critical care area for at least 1 year (usually much more) before returning to school for 2+ years for specialty training in anesthesia. CRNAs are masters prepared. (except for older ones that trained prior to a masters degree requirement.) Both anesthesiologist and CRNAs are very educated and capable of delivering quality anesthesia care. The main difference in my opinion is that CRNAs bring compassion and a human touch into the anesthesia setting.Anesthesiologist vs Nurse Anesthetist. Doctors and nurses usually have distinct responsibilities. Doctors treat the patient by giving orders and directions. Nurses treat the patient by carrying out the orders of the doctors. Some difficult procedures should not be done by nurses because there will be a breach in responsibilities and tasks. There is a major difference between anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists. To make things at ease, the former is a doctor who specializes in anesthesiology while the latter is a nurse who studied and trained for a few more years before becoming an anesthetist. On the other side of nursing, for a nurse to become a nurse anesthetist, he or she completes a Bachelor’s degree. Then the individual must pass the nursing exam or NCLEX in the US. After passing the exam, a hospital experience is required for a minimum of one year.
how many hours are able to be billable in a week	The upside to this is, you can bill 16 hours in a day. The trial can go on for a long time, and you will have the billable hours of a superstar. Last trial, I was able to average about 12.5 hours a day for about 6 weeks. A few weeks, came out with over 90 billable hours. In a matter of 6 weeks, I had about 525 billable hours under my belt. This allowed me to take a few vacations and still be on pace to hit my quota. There are periods where you are grinding it out, and you will have awesome time/service reportTo figure out billable hours, let's consider how many total hours you work in a week. If you consider that there are 40 hours in a typical work week, and there are 50 working weeks a year, then you work a total of 2,000 hours a year. If you work 10 hours a day, that s 50 hours a week, and 2,500 hours a year. But how many of those working hours are billable? That s the question, and you ll have to do some figuring on your own to answer it. The hours would be only the time you spend working on the inspection itself. Assume each job takes five hours, including driving time, inspecting time, and report-writing time. And you expect to do one job per day. That s five hours per day of billable hours, 25 hours per week, and 1,250 billable hours per year. Now that you've figured out your billable hours per job and per year, let's work on your flat rate, or your average fee for one inspection of a typical home in your marke

food poisoning caused by what	Introduction. Food poisoning occurs when you eat food contaminated with bacteria or other toxins. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, and generally start 4 to 36 hours after eating contaminated food. While food poisoning is often caused by bacteria, it can also result from eating poisonous plants (some mushrooms, for instance) and animals (pufferfish). Food poisoning is especially common during summer when food may not be kept cold enough to prevent bacteria from growing. Usually bacteria and algae cause food poisoning, but poisonous plants and animals are other potential causes. Common bacterial causes include: 1  E. coli in undercooked hamburger, unpasteurized apple juice or cider, raw milk, contaminated water (or ice), vegetables fertilized by cow manure, or spread from person to person.Food poisoning is a common, yet distressing and sometimes life-threatening problem for millions of people in the U.S. and throughout the world. People infected with food-borne organisms may be symptom-free or may have symptoms ranging from mild intestinal discomfort to severe dehydration and bloody diarrhea. Depending on the type of infection, people can even die as a result of food poisoning. More than 250 different diseases can cause food poisoning. Some of the most common diseases are infections caused by bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, botulism, and norovirus

what is osi stability analysis	A mathematical conversion can be used to convert the OSI time into a corresponding AOM time. REFERENCES Ofﬁ cial Methods of Analysis of AOCS, Cd 12b-92, “Oil Stability Index”“Collaborative Study of the Oil Stability Index Analysis”. Tod A. Jebe, Mark G. Matlock and Ronald T. Sleeter. The test tube is then placed in a heating block at a temperature of 110°C. Clean, dry air is bubbled through the sample, and the efﬂ uent stream of air is bubbled through a collection tube ﬁ lled with ultra pure water. An electrode is placed in the water, and the instrument monitors the conductivity.All fats and oils are prone to oxidation. The rapidity of oxidation depends on the degree of unsaturation, the presence of antioxidants, and prior storage conditions. In the OSI analysis, the rate of oxidation is slow until any resistance to oxidation is overcome. This time is known as the oxidation induction period. After the induction period, the rate of oxidation increases dramatically. Unlike peroxide value and free fatty acid analyses which give an idea of how good or bad an oil is at a particular time, the OSI analysis has predictive value.

why was the schlieffen plan created	The Schlieffen Plan. The Schlieffen Plan was created by General Count Alfred von Schlieffen in December 1905. The Schlieffen Plan was the operational plan for a designated attack on France once Russia, in response to international tension, had started to mobilise her forces near the German border. The execution of the Schlieffen Plan led to Britain declaring war on Germany on August 4th, 1914. This would allow Germany time (the six weeks that Schlieffen had built into his plan) to transfer soldiers who had been fighting in the successful French campaign to Russia to take on the Russians. Schlieffen also planned for the attack on France to go through Belgium and Luxemburg. Belgium had had her neutrality guaranteed by Britain in 1839 – so his strategy for success depended on Britain not supporting Belgium. The Schlieffen Plan was revised as tension in Europe increasedThe most influential plan was that of Germany – the Schlieffen Plan – drawn up in 1905 by General Alfred von Schlieffen. It relied on three things: The Schlieffen Plan. It was an ambitious plan designed to avoid Germany having to fight a two-front war against France and Russia. Despite having alliances with France and Russia, Britain had made no firm promises to help them in war. However, Britain had promised in 1834 to protect the neutrality of Belgium if she was ever attacked. The Schlieffen Plan required the German army to attack France through Belgium.
what biome do squirrels live in	The arctic ground squirrel's main habitat is the arctic tundra. The squirrels live in the sandy soil for easy digging and good drainage. The arctic ground squirrel's main habitats are on mountain slopes, river flats, banks, lakeshores and tundra ridges. The arctic ground squirrel's over all length is 1-1.3 feet long and the tail length is 3-5 inches. Their average weight is 23-28 ounces. The arctic ground squirrel is oval shaped. The color of the arctic ground squirrel's coat is gray, spotted with white and is light brown with touches of cinnamon. Arctic ground squirrels are social animals. Groups of arctic ground squirrels are called colonies and a male leads the group. Arctic ground squirrels do not migrate but males will some times immigrate to different colonies. The life span of males is six years and the life span of females is eleven years.1 Major plant form: deciduous (i.e., trees that seasonally drop their leaves) flowering trees and shrubs. 2  Typical temperate deciduous forest areas are the northeastern U.S. and most of Europe. 3  Typical vertebrates: deer, wolf, bear, foxes, many migratory birds, squirrels, rabbits, etc. 1 Located just south of the polar regions in the northern hemisphere. 2  Arid (as are the polar regions). 3  Characterized by PERMAFROST: a permanently frozen layer of soil, which may be deeper in summer than in winter, but still prevents the growth of large trees with deep root systems.
what organs are located in the thoracic cavity	Summary Information: Thoracic Cavity. Thoracic Cavity: The thoracic cavity is an enclosed chamber located within the ventral cavity that contains some of the body's organs and structures. The thoracic cavity includes the pleural cavity, thoracic aorta, pulmonary vein, pulmonary artery, vena cavas, heart, and lungs. Descriptions of Thoracic Cavity. Thoracic Cavity: the cavity in the vertebrate body enclosed by the ribs between the diaphragm and the neck and containing the lungs and heart. Source: WordNet 2.1. Thoracic Cavity: The region of the thorax that includes the PLEURAL CAVITY and MEDIASTINUM. Source: MESH OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies)There are many cavities in the human body, for example, the cranial cavity in the head, the thoracic cavity, the abdominopelvic body cavity below the thoracic cavity, and the dorsal cavity that covers the backside of the body, etc. Thoracic cavity or the chest cavity is an important chamber in the human body. It is the second largest cavity in the body. The ribs, vertebral column, muscles, connective tissues, and the sternum (breast bone) enclose this cavity. The thoracic cavity is lined by a serous membrane that exudes a thin fluid (serum). Parietal lymph nodes located in the thoracic wall and visceral lymph nodes that are associated with the internal organs comprise thoracic lymph nodes. There are empty spaces (cavities) in the thoracic cavity that are lined with mesothelium.

Application this strategy has already been applied in. maizeThe principal carbohydrate of all cereals is starch, representing 56 percent (oats) to 80 percent (maize) of the grain dry matter (Eliasson and Larsson 1993). Cereal starches are similar in composition, having 74-79 percent amylopectin, 25-30 percent amylose, and 1 percent lipids. The lipid content of maize ranges between 0.4 percent and 17 percent, most of which are triacylglycerides (Eliasson and Larsson 1993). Different cultivars of a given type of cereal exhibit compositional variability. The chemical components of cereals are not uniformly distributed in the grain (Table 3). Hulls and bran are high in cellulose, pentosans and ash. The aleurone layer of wheat contains 25 times more minerals than the endosperm; whereas the lipids are generally concentrated in the aleurone and germ
how does the epithelial tissue found in the epidermis of the skin differ in structure from the connective tissue found in the dermis of the skin	Types of epithelial tissue Connective tissue-Connective tissues are fibrous tissues. They are comprised of cells separated by non-living material, which is called extracellular matrix. Connective tissue holds other tissues together such as in the formation of organs, and has the ability to stretch... Types of epithelial tissue Connective tissue-Connective ... Cell P2 – Describe the four main tissue types in the body Inside the body, there are four mains types of tissue which include the Epithelial, Muscular, Nervous and Connective. Tissues are known as groups of cells which have a certain structure to retain a specific job.Collagen is the fibrous protein constituent of skin, cartilage, bone, and other connective tissue. Collagen is the principal constituent of the fiber-network layer of our skin. More than a third of the body's protein is collagen, and it can account for an even higher percentage in particular parts of the body. Skin is the body's largest organ. It comprises three layers: the epidermis, the dermis and the subcutaneous layer. The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin, composed of cells called epithelial cells. The dermis, the layer underneath the epidermis, contains blood vessels, lymphatic tissue, nerves, sweat glands, hair follicles and sebaceous glands-glands that produce and secrete oil to protect against bacteria. The third layer, the subcutaneous layer, is a supporting layer of fatty tissue
why driving age should be raised	The driving age should be raised because over 5,000 teens die because they are careless, and I do not want to be hit by a careless teen!!! not all should be punished for the careless few that are driving. I think that if they made the driving test more complicated than it would reduce the wreckless teens on the road. We can help lower the accident rates if the driving age is raised to 18 so no more kids can get hurt or killed in a accident on the freeway or by another car crashing into their car if we raise the driving age it will be safer for the young and old drivers.The minimum drivers license age should not be raised to 18 because 16-year-olds are more responsible and have a much more focused mind. The minimum age to obtain one's driver’s license should not be raised to 18 because 16-year-olds have a much more focused mind. If you change the minimum driving age to 18, it will be very little different from 16-year-olds because either way they wouldn't have very much driving experience. Some parents just do not want their children to drive when they are teenagers because parents start to get a little worried. The driving age should be raised up to 18 because teens can be a little careless. Driving at the age of 18 is a more mature age for teens because they can have more responsibility. Teens should not be driving at the age of 16 because they could be texting and driving or drinking and driving with some friends

what height should a patio table be	A 48 round table can seat 6-8 people depending on the size of the chairs. The minimum patio size to accommodate a 48 round table is 10 feet 6 inches. This allows enough space to pull out chairs, but not much walk around space. Use 12-14 feet as a minimum patio size allotment for each 48 round table you intend to accommodate. Size your patio based on your entertaining needs and the number of people you plan to host regularly. View this patio sizing chart for standard round and rectangular spacing. 1 Make the patio large enough to accommodate a small table and at least two chairs. 2  A good size for a bistro patio is about 6 to 7 feet in diameter. 3  When it comes to stamp pattern choices, smaller is usually better. 4  Consider using cobblestone or brick versus large field stone or slate patterns.The average height of a patio umbrella pole is 8 feet. Some can be taller, but most you'll find will be about 8 feet tall. A few umbrella poles may be curved or offset to hang the patio umbrella over an area without a pole being in the way of the outdoor furniture or activity in the area. Most offset umbrella poles will still set the umbrella about 8 feet above the ground. They are perfect for adding a lot of shade to a poolside patio, a back yard, or open deck. The most popular shade sails are shaped as rectangles, squares, or triangles. Shade sails can be small, but most begin at around 9 feet and can be as big as 20 feet.

what do antioxidants do for skin	If you're like most people, you want smooth, healthy skin, but maybe you don't want to wade through hundreds of chemically laden products to get it. That's where antioxidants can help. Incorporating the right antioxidants into your diet and skin care routine can have a positive effect on your skin. Antioxidants are nutrients (vitamins and minerals) and enzymes (proteins inside your body) that can help to prevent and repair damage to your body's tissue. In most cases, all you need to fulfill your body's quota for antioxidants is a healthy and balanced diet. In fact, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before increasing your intake of any supplement. To learn more about antioxidants and skin care, look over the links on the next page.Your skin is your largest organ, so it is important to take care of it. Antioxidants protect skin by limiting the production of free radicals, which can damage skin cells. Antioxidants in skin care products can do a lot for the health and appearance of your skin, including reducing the signs of aging. From calming inflamed skin to tightening and toning, antioxidants offer great benefits from natural sources. One of the most desirable benefits of antioxidants in skin-care products is the calming of inflammation. Antioxidants, such as alpha lipoic acid and others found in pine bark and green tea, produce valuable anti-inflammatory results by increasing circulation and cell metabolism.

how deep should a planter be?	For most plants, a 6-to 8-inch-deep planter box is sufficient. The depth may vary for some vegetables, however. Turnips, cucumbers, broccoli, beets, lettuce and green onions can all grow well in a planter box at that depth, but other vegetables, like cabbage, need a deeper depth of at least 10 inches. Annuals flowers most often have a shallow root system and grow well in a planter box with an 8-inch depth. Perennials, like bulbs, require a deeper planting box depth. Large bulbs require a planting depth of 8 inches, which means the planter box should allow for the 6 inches needed at the bottom, as discussed earlier, making the depth at least 14 inches. Most smaller bulbs are planted at 3 to 4 inches deep, so they would do fine in planter box with an 8-inch depthDepending on the cultivar, tomato plants grow upward to approximately 3 feet; their deep root structures mirror their height so that they can support the weight above. Preferably, an 18-inch deep planter box should be used to hold a healthy tomato plant, depending on the variety. These heavy planters should be placed on a patio floor or sturdy table. Seed Planting. Tiny tomato seeds do not need to be planted very deep within the planter box; a 1/4 inch planting depth is sufficient for germinating seeds so they can push out from the growing medium. However, the planter box itself needs to hold at least 5 gallons of soil in order to grow a healthy tomato plant
why are arteries and veins important	Arteries and Veins. As we stated on the previous page, What Is High Blood Pressure , arteries and veins are both part of the circulatory system and carry blood from the heart to the lungs and to all other parts of our bodies. Both are very important in maintaining our blood pressure. Though they both carry blood through our bodies they are very different and are even made of different tissue and perform their own functions in specific ways. Arteries. Arteries carry blood which is full of oxygen away from the heart. Arteries have three layers of tissue-the outside and inside layers are made of a connective tissue which covers the muscular middle layer of smooth muscle, and elastic fibers. These tissues provide a smooth path for our blood to flow throughMost veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart. Veins are less muscular than arteries and are often closer to the skin. There are valves in most veins to prevent backflow. However, in pulmonary circulation, the arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, and veins return blood from the lungs to the heart. The difference between veins and arteries is their direction of flow (out of the heart by arteries, returning to the heart for veins), not their oxygen content.
which command allows you to reverse an undo command?	Undoing and Redoing Changes. 1  As you edit clips and perform other operations in both multitrack and audio file projects, you might need to use the Undo and Redo commands. For example, if you don’t like the last change you’ve made to a project, it can usually be undone.

how long is recovery after hip replacement	It should be noted, however, that recovery time for a total hip replacement can differ vastly from patient to patient. Some patients may take 6 months to recover; while others may recover in just 4 weeks. About Bonesmart.org. Once a patient no longer needs walking aids and can walk around the house without pain--in addition to being able to walk two blocks around the house without pain or resting--all of these are considered signs of short-term recovery. The average short-term recovery time for a total hip replacement is 4 to 6 weeks. Long-term recovery involves the complete healing of surgical wounds and internal soft tissues. When a patient can return to work and the activities of daily living, they are on the way to achieving the full term of recoveryGenerally speaking, hip replacement patients do recover sooner than knee replacement patients, for example.

Exercise related soreness is caused by what	The severity of soreness you experience depends on the type of stress placed on the muscle. Exercise with a strong eccentric component, for example, running downhill, is shown to increase the chance of DOMS, which can last up to 5 days post workout. DOMS occurs within hours or days after your workout and often causes tenderness, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. Starting recovery immediately after your workout can greatly reduce muscle soreness and fatigue, and have you well on your way to a stronger, healthier body. Here is what we suggest. Water.The soreness is caused by eccentric exercise, that is, exercise consisting of eccentric (lengthening) contractions of the muscle. Isometric (static) exercise causes much less soreness, and concentric (shortening) exercise causes none. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), also called muscle fever, is the pain and stiffness felt in muscles several hours to days after unaccustomed or strenuous exercise. The soreness is felt most strongly 24 to 72 hours after the exercise. It is thought to be caused by eccentric (lengthening) exercise, which causes microtrauma to the muscle fibers. After such exercise, the muscle adapts rapidly to prevent muscle damage, and thereby soreness, if the exercise is repeated. Delayed onset muscle soreness is one symptom of exercise-induced muscle damage. The other is acute muscle soreness, which appears during and immediately after exercis

how does your body prepare for anesthesia	In most cases, patients are required to abstain from eating and drinking after midnight on the night before their scheduled surgery to reduce the chances of vomiting while under anesthesia. When a person is under general anesthesia, the body does not work normally. Certain reflexes are relaxed, and if vomiting occurs, it may enter the lungs, leading to serious complications. Every precaution is taken to avoid this occurrence. Adhering to the no food after midnight rule is essential for patient safety. A patient receiving local anesthesia without sedation for a minor procedure generally does not have any dietary restrictions, but this should always be discussed with the surgeon prior to surgery. Before surgery, the anesthesiologist visits the patient to do a brief physical examination and to obtain a medical history.1 If you take any medicines regularly, ask your doctor or nurse about changes to your medicine routine for the day before or the day of your surgery. 2  Try to stay calm. 3  Many people are nervous before they have anesthesia and surgery. 4  Mental relaxation methods, such as guided imagery or meditation, can help you relax. 1 Know when to stop eating and drinking. 2  If you take any medicines regularly, ask your doctor or nurse about changes to your medicine routine for the day before or the day of your surgery. 3  Try to stay calm. 4  Many people are nervous before they have anesthesia and surgery.
where does phlegm come from	Introduction. Mucus is an important part of your body's ability to protect itself from foreign invaders ranging from allergens to viruses and bacteria. Though it may feel like a pain to have a runny nose, or cough of phlegm, it is the mucus in these substances that actually helps you get better faster. Mucus is a mixture of approximately 95 percent water and five percent salt, fat, carbohydrates and proteins. Where It Comes From. Mucus comes from your mucus glands around the nose and sinus cavities. A healthy person will normally generate about a pint of mucus per day. This mucus runs down your nasal cavities to both keep them moist, as well as attract and trap and foreign particles that enter the nose.Phlegm is a mucus-like substance produced by the lower airways, such as the lungs and the respiratory system leading to the lungs, not by the nose and sinuses, which produce the mucus that streams out of or clogs up your nose. You may not notice phlegm unless you cough it up as a symptom of bronchitis or pneumonia. As is the case with mucus, phlegm that has a color such as green or yellow may indicate infection. Any time you see blood in the phlegm you cough up, you should seek medical attention. 3. 1 Post-nasal drip (thick mucus). 2  Take an expectorant (this thins mucus and phlegm), drink lots of fluids, breathe through a warm washcloth, and use steam to make the mucus more liquid. 3  Congestion (blocked nose).
other name for leeks	Well, leeks are part of the onion family and, in fact, look like a giant version of green onions. However, the little green onion has a much stronger onion flavor then the leek. Another difference is that you need to cook leeks before eating them. Unlike an onion, you would not add an uncooked leek to a salad! Green Onions. Leeks are a very mellow version of an onion and when cut they have a beautiful variation in color. They go from white down by the root, to a yellow center, to a really dark green at the top. Cut the leek just below the really dark green part. Those really dark, green leaves are very tough and you don’t eat them. Like an onion, the leek has a lot of layers on the inside, except that the leek has a lot more finer layers. Each of these layers has an amazing amount of sandy grit between them.Allium tricoccum (commonly known as ramp, ramps, spring onion, ramson, wild leek, wood leek, and wild garlic) is a North American species of wild onion widespread across eastern Canada and the eastern United States. Many of these English names are used for other Allium species, particularly Allium ursinum. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The name ramps (usually plural) is one of the many dialectical variants of the English word ramson, a common name of the European bear leek (Allium ursinum), a broad-leaved species of garlic much cultivated and eaten in salads, a plant related to our American species.

The Pacinian corpuscle named by its Italian discoverer Filippo Pacini (si splendido uomo!*) is a 1 mm diameter skin receptor which enables us to perceive pressure and vibration. This is the receptor responsible for our awareness off smooth vs rough surfaces, shallow vs intense tactile sensation, etc. The Pacinian corpuscle is a good representative of receptors' specificity i.e. the response only takes place in the presence of specific stimuli such as pressure. Grazie, Filippo!**. 2. Rods and Cones are the two main specialised eye photon receptors and differ in their distribution and sensitivity.
what an allele is	Diploid organisms have one copy of each gene (and, therefore, one allele) on each chromosome. If both alleles are the same, they and the organism are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they and the organism are heterozygous with respect to that gene. The word allele is a short form of allelomorph (other form), which was used in the early days of genetics to describe variant forms of a gene detected as different phenotypes. The frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see Hardy-Weinberg principle). For a simple model, with two alleles: where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the alternative allele, which necessarily sum to unity.Definition: An allele is an alternative form of a gene (one member of a pair) that is located at a specific position on a specific chromosome. These DNA codings determine distinct traits that can be passed on from parents to offspring through sexual reproduction. When the alleles of a pair are heterozygous, one may be dominant and the other recessive. The dominant allele is expressed and the recessive allele is masked. This is an example of complete dominance. In heterozygous relationships where neither allele is dominant but both are completely expressed, the alleles are considered to be co-dominant. Co-dominance is exemplified in AB blood type inheritance
what are good urinalysis results	A urinalysis is a group of chemical and microscopic tests. They detect the byproducts of normal and abnormal metabolism, cells, cellular fragments, and bacteria in urine. Urine is produced by the kidneys, two fist-sized organs located on either side of the spine at the bottom of the ribcage. Urine for a urinalysis can be collected at any time. The first morning sample is considered the most valuable because it is more concentrated and more likely to yield abnormalities if present. It is important to clean the genitalia before collecting urine. Bacteria and cells from the surrounding skin can contaminate the sample and interfere with the interpretation of test results. With women, menstrual blood and vaginal secretions can also be a source of contaminationUrinalysis should be performed within 15 minutes of collecting the urine sample. If that is not possible, the urine should be refrigerated. Some parts of routine urinalysis are performed using a dipstick test or tablet test, and others are completed using microscopic (under a microscope) evaluation in a laboratory. In patients who have kidney disease or diabetes, urine tests are used to monitor the condition. Urinalysis also may be performed to detect a urinary tract infection (UTI) , protein in the urine (proteinuria), or blood in the urine (hematuria), and to diagnose pregnancy. Toxicology screening can be used as part of urinalysis to detect illegal drug use
what is soy sauce	Soy sauce (also called soya sauce) is a condiment made from a fermented paste of boiled soybeans, roasted grain, brine, and Aspergillus oryzae or Aspergillus sojae molds. After fermentation, the paste is pressed, producing a liquid, which is the soy sauce, and a solid byproduct, which is often used as animal feed. Soy sauce has a distinct yet basic taste of umami, due to naturally occurring free glutamates. Varieties of soy sauce are salty, earthy, brownish liquids intended to season food while cooking or at the table. Many kinds of soy sauce are made in Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma and other countries. Variation is usually achieved as the result of different methods and durations of fermentation, different ratios of water, salt, and fermented soy, or through the addition of other ingredientsMatthew O'Shea/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Soy sauce is a brown, salty, liquid used as a condiment or seasoning in many Asian cuisines. Soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans, salt, water and sometimes roasted grains. Soy sauce has an earthy, umami flavor, which makes it an ideal all-purpose seasoning. Low Sodium Soy Sauce – Salt is an important component in the production of soy sauce because it acts as an antimicrobial agent. Most low sodium soy sauces are made using the acid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein method, which does not utilize bacterial and fungal cultures and therefore requires less salt.

different types of fins in fish and their importance	Apart from the tail or caudal fin, fins have no direct connection with the spine and are supported by muscles only. Their principal function is to help the fish swim. Fins located in different places on the fish serve different purposes, such as moving forward, turning, keeping an upright position or stopping. Most fish use fins when swimming, flying fish use pectoral fins for gliding, and frogfish use them for crawling. A fish can have up to three dorsal fins. The dorsal fins serve to protect the fish against rolling, and assist it in sudden turns and stops. 1  In anglerfish, the anterior of the dorsal fin is modified into an illicium and esca, a biological equivalent to a fishing rod and lure.To be able identify and discuss fish, it is helpful to know all the types of fish fins. It makes descriptions much easier, and there really aren't that many. Here are the eight types of fish fins: 1  Dorsal fins are found on the back of the fish. 2  There may be up to three of them. 3  The fish uses this fin for balance in the water and sudden movements. 4  Caudal fins are also known as tail fins. 1 Dorsal fins are found on the back of the fish. 2  There may be up to three of them. 3  The fish uses this fin for balance in the water and sudden movements. 4  Caudal fins are also known as tail fins. 5  This is what we refer to as the fish's tail. 6  Anal fins are on the ventral (bottom) surface of the fish, behind the anu

why are spices used in foods in india	Spices and herbs at a grocery shop in Goa, India. A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, berry, bud or vegetable substance primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving food. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are parts of leafy green plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Many spices have antimicrobial properties. This may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates, which have more infectious disease, and why the use of spices is prominent in meat, which is particularly susceptible to spoiling. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form. The flavor of a spice is derived in part from compounds (volatile oils) that oxidize or evaporate when exposed to air. Grinding a spice greatly increases its surface area and so increases the rates of oxidation and evaporation.Tadka translates as tempering.. It is a method widely used in Indian cuisine, in which whole or ground spices are heated in hot oil or ghee and the mixture is added to a dish. Hot fat has an amazing ability to extract and retain the essence, aroma and flavor of spices and herbs and then carry this essence with it when it is added to a dish. 1 Some of the ingredients commonly used for Indian tadkas are cumin, cinnamon, curry leaves, mustard seeds, asafoetida and red chilies. 2  The crackling of the spices or change in their color indicates that the process is complete.

when do puppies lose teeth	Most puppies begin to lose their deciduous (baby) teeth at around 12 weeks of age, although there can be quite a bit of normal variation. In general, small breeds tend to begin losing teeth later than large breeds. Teeth are usually lost front to back, starting with the incisors and ending with the pre-molars. This makes room for the permanent teeth to erupt normally. As with the deciduous teeth, the permanent incisors are the first to come in, followed by the canine teeth, and the premolars. The last teeth to erupt in the adult set are the molars. Puppies do not have molars, which is why there are fewer deciduous teeth. In most breeds of dogs, all of the permanent teeth should be present by about 8 months of ageDogs have two sets of teeth: 28 deciduous (baby) teeth, which will eventually be replaced by 42 permanent (adult) teeth. When a puppy is two or three weeks old, the deciduous teeth begin to erupt through the gums, starting with the incisors, followed by the canine teeth, and finally the premolars. This makes room for the permanent teeth to erupt normally. As with the deciduous teeth, the permanent incisors are the first to come in, followed by the canine teeth, and the premolars. The last teeth to erupt in the adult set are the molars. Puppies do not have molars, which is why there are fewer deciduous teeth. In most breeds of dogs, all of the permanent teeth should be present by about 8 months of age
how does a breathalyzer test work	A breathalyzer is a device that can estimate your blood-alcohol level. If your blood-alcohol level is higher than the legal limit, you will be arrested for drunk driving. There are certain rules that vary from state to state about whether a police officer may force you to take a breathalyzer test. Refusing the Breathalyzer Test. The consequences of refusing a breathalyzer test can be severe depending on your state's laws. If you do refuse to take a breathalyzer test, you may have your license automatically suspended from 90 days all the way up to a year. Not only that, but you will be prosecuted for drunk driving and be subject to the usual types of DUI punishment, which may include fines, jail time, and community serviceA breathalyzer or breathalyser (a portmanteau of breath and analyzer/analyser) is a device for estimating blood alcohol content (BAC) from a breath sample. Breathalyzer is the brand name for the instrument that tests the alcohol level developed by inventor Robert Frank Borkenstein. It was registered as a trademark on May 13, 1954, but many people use the term to refer to any generic device for estimating blood alcohol content. Where the defendant had refused to take a subsequent blood test, the only way the state could prove BAC was by presenting scientific evidence of how alcohol in the breath gets there from alcohol in the blood, along with evidence of how to convert from one to the other.
where is the freshwater biome located in the world	Freshwater biomes are very important to life on Earth. They are home to many different species and provide a lot of resources. In this lesson, we will go over what a freshwater biome is, where they are located, and the different plants and animals that inhabit them. However, 97% of water is actually salt water, and 2% of all the water is freshwater that is locked up in the glaciers. This leaves only 1% of freshwater found around the Earth. Still, freshwater biomes are found all around the world. Lake Victoria in South Central Africa, as well as the Great Lakes of the Midwest U.S. and Canada, are very well known freshwater areas. Lake Baikal in Southern Siberia is the largest freshwater lake in the worldA unique place where two habitats come together is called an ecotone. Because estuaries are usually shallow, sunlight can reach all levels of the water. PLANTS: Plants and algae are important to freshwater biomes because they provide oxygen through photosynthesis, and food for animals in this biome. Yum, delicious algae. In fact, that slimy scum you see on the surface of a pond or lake is lunch for many of your favorite aquatic animals, like turtles. There are a variety of fish, birds, insects, amphibians, and crustaceans that make freshwater biomes their home. One important freshwater animal in the United States is the trout. Many people love to fish for, and eat trout. Trout live in both streams and rivers.
what is crepe fabric made of	Crepe is a type of thin fabric known for its distinctive crinkled texture and wrinkled appearance. Crepe fabric was originally only made using silk, but nowadays all types of fabrics including cotton, chiffon and rayon are used to create crepe. Therefore the question ‘what is crepe fabric made of’ does not have a simple or straightforward answer. The one common factor for all these different types of crepe fabrics is that they are always made by an elaborate process of weaving and knitting to get the crinkled yet light appearance. French crepe fabric is another very fine and light type of fabric known for its slightly flatter appearance and more subtle crinkles. Both of these are used to make lehenga cholis and sarees as well as salwar kameez and tunics. Besides silk, satin is also sometimes used to make beautiful crepe fabrics for formal wear.Crepe Fabric. By Susan W. Greene. Crepe is the name given to fabric having a crinkled or pebbled texture, often used for blouses and dresses with graceful drape. Almost any fiber may be used, and the fabric can be thin and sheer, fine and opaque, or even heavy. Crepe (alt. crape) fabric may be stretchy, requiring care to cut and sew accurately. The second type of crepe is made of yarns with ordinary twist in a weave having small, irregular floats that look fairly bumpy. This method is most effective in heavy fabrics whose larger threads produce an appreciable texture.
how to overcome loneliness and depression	1 Try to find good people in good groups. 2  If you have a persistent feeling of loneliness, seek medical help. 3  It might be a sign of depression. 4  If you're feeling lonely, consider taking a break from social media websites like Facebook and Twitter—they do not help your social relationships. 1 To get started with meditation, find a quiet spot and get comfortable. 2  You can either sit in a chair or on a cushion on the floor with your legs crossed. 3  Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. 4  As you focus on your breathing, try not to get distracted by your thoughts.Feeling lonely can plague many people — including the elderly, people who are isolated, and those with depression — with symptoms such as sadness, isolation, and withdrawal. Loneliness can strike a person who lives alone or someone who lives in a house filled with people. Feelings of loneliness don’t have to be constant to call for action, but you will need to give yourself a push to get back into the thick of life and re-engage with others to start feeling better. These strategies for fighting depression and loneliness can help: 1  Make a plan. 2  Do something — anything. 3  Explore your faith. 4  Bond with a dog. 5  Have realistic standards. 6  Think beyond yourself. 7  Reach out to a lonely person. 8  Call, don’t post. 9  Make time for relationships. 10  Talk to a trusted friend or relative. 11  Meditate. 12  Explore therapy
the hawaiian islands are associated with what type of volcanism	This review presents some of the current knowledge of volcanoes in Hawai'i. It was originally written for a NASA-sponsored workshop about Hawaiian volcanism. We hope that with this review you can gain a better understanding of the processes and landforms that are associated with Hawaiian volcanoes. Many of these processes and features can also be found at other basaltic volcanoes on Earth. The Hawaiian shield volcanoes are the largest volcanoes on earth (e.g. Peterson & Moore 1987) rising some 9 km above the ocean floor (see image), with volumes of 42,500 and 24,800 cubic kilometers (not counting subsidence) for Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, respectively.[ HCV Home ] [Formation of the Islands] [ Active Hawaiian Volcanoes ] [ General Info ]. Follow site author @kenrubin on Twitter. The Hawaiian Islands are volcanic in origin. Each island is made up of at least one primary volcano, although many islands are composites of more than one. The Big Island, for instance, is constructed of 5 major volcanoes: Kilauea, Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, Hualalai and Kohala. Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on Earth. As the plate moves over a fixed spot deeper in the Earth where magma (molten lava) forms, a new volcano can punch through this plate and create an island. The Hawaiian Islands are believed to be formed from one such 'hot spot'. As the plate moves away, the volcano stops erupting and a new one is formed in its place.
what cell structure	There are two primary types of cells: eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are called so because they have a true nucleus. The nucleus, which houses DNA, is contained within a membrane and separated from other cellular structures. Prokaryotic cells however have no true nucleus. DNA in a prokaryotic cell is not separated from the rest of the cell but coiled up in a region called the nucleoid. As organized in the Three Domain System, prokaryotes include archaeans and bacteria. Eukaryotes include animals, plants, fungi and protists. On average, prokaryotic cells are about 10 times smaller in diameter than eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes grow and reproduce through a process called mitosis. In organisms that also reproduce sexually, the reproductive cells are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis.Cell Structure. The structure of cells varies according to the type and purpose of the cell (for example, which functions it is performing and in which part of the body). All plant and animal cells contain organelles which are structures within the cell that are specialised for particular functions. Cell Membrane. The cell membrane keeps the cell together by containing the organelles within it. Cell membranes are selectively-permeable, allowing materials to move both into and outside of the cell. Centrosomes. The centrosomes contain the centrioles, which are responsible for cell-division.
what kind of vitamins is good for liver	Once cirrhosis -- which means severe scarring and fibrosis -- develops in liver tissue, the cirrhotic part will never regenerate. B-complex vitamins can help with effects of cirrhosis such as memory loss and nerve damage if you have liver damage, especially if you drink heavily. B Vitamins and Your Liver. Liver disease can cause vitamin B deficiencies. The B-complex family comprises eight different B vitamins. Vitamin B deficiency most often occurs in alcoholics as a result of poor diet. B-complex vitamins often affected by liver disease include B1, or thiamine; B-6; and B-12. Around 90 percent of your B-12 stores are found in the liver, according to a January 2009 article in Practical Gastroenterology, so damage to the liver decreases B-12 storesVitamins to Choose. Vitamins A and E help the liver rid the body of waste products. Eating dark green and orange fruits and vegetables will help you meet the vitamin A recommended dietary allowance of 700 to 900 micrograms daily for adults. The active form of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, has an RDA of 15 micrograms, which you can meet by incorporating vegetable oils sources and nuts into your diet. Not only does it metabolize the food you eat, but it also plays a supportive role in eliminating waste products from your body. Keeping your liver working well is crucial to your health, and you can do this by regularly incorporating certain vitamins into your regimen.

what is sun in	The photosphere is the lowest layer of the sun's atmosphere, and emits the light we see. It is about 300 miles (500 km) thick, although most of the light comes from its lowest third. Temperatures in the photosphere range from 11,000 F (6,125 C) at bottom to 7,460 F (4,125 C) at top. The solar atmosphere above that consists of the photosphere, chromosphere, a transition region and the corona. Beyond that is the solar wind, an outflow of gas from the corona. The core extends from the sun's center to about a quarter of the way to its surface. Although it only makes up roughly 2 percent of the sun's volume, it is almost 15 times the density of leadand holds nearly half of the sun's mass. Next is the radiative zone, which extends from the core to 70 percent of the way to the sun's surface, making up 32 percent of the sun's volume and 48 percent of its massThe Sun (in Greek: Helios, in Latin: Sol) is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. In the Sun's outer layer, from its surface to approximately 200,000 km below (70% of the solar radius from the center), the temperature is lower than in the radiative zone and heavier atoms are not fully ionized. As a result, radiative heat transport is less effective.
what is home meal replacement (hmr)	HMR opportunities abound for retailers. Lately all of the talk in the retail landscape has been around increased competition in the Canadian marketplace. Certainly there’s been a great deal of excitement among Canadian consumers; but there’s also causing a great deal of consternation among retailers that already play in the market. While retailers fortify their positions and get ready to do battle, I would suggest that as in sports “the best defense is a good offence”.About the Program. Home Meal Replacements are nutritious frozen meals that are flash-frozen, without any extra preservatives added. These meals are arranged to be ordered every two (2) weeks. Meals include entrée, soup, and a dessert. As well these meals are suitable for diabetics, and those requiring low-salt or low-fat diets.

how long does it take for a boil to heal	Learn How long Does it Takes to Heal a Boil. The boils are formed by bacterial infection called, Staph. They are red in color and the affected part is swollen and filled with pus. The pus that is formed inside the boils contains bacteria. It is only when the pus comes out the boil is cured. In some cases small boils are cured without head formation. They can be cured either by giving warm compresses or by applying creams. In this case the boil is absorbed by the body. Many people say that the boils heal on their own but it is not true they need to be treated they do not heal on their own. It takes approximately 10 to 25 days for a boil to heal up and that too depends on the boil or the bacterial infection suffered by the skin. A doctor can drain the pus from the boil by a minor surgery. He would give local anesthesia on the affected area and make a cut on the boil and allow the pus to move outBoils may take from 1 to 3 weeks to heal. In most cases, a boil will not heal until it opens and drains. This can take up to a week. A carbuncle often requires treatment by your healthcare provider. Depending on the severity of the problem and its treatment, the carbuncle should heal in 2 to 3 weeks after treatment. 1 Wash your hands and then put a warm, moist cloth on the boil or carbuncle for 10 to 15 minutes at least 3 times a day. 2  This helps the boil come to a head and drain on its own--the safe way to drain.
what causes brain shrinkage	Cerebral atrophy is a common feature of many of the diseases that affect the brain. Atrophy of any tissue means a decrement in the size of the cell, which can be due to progressive loss of cytoplasmic proteins. In brain tissue, atrophy describes a loss of neurons and the connections between them. Atrophy can be generalized, which means that all of the brain has shrunk; or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of the brain and resulting in a decrease of the functions that area of the brain controls. Some degree of cerebral shrinkage occurs naturally with age; after the brain completes growth and attains its maximum mass at around age 25, it gradually loses mass with each decade of life, although the rate of loss is comparatively tiny until the age of 60, when approximately .5 to 1% of brain volume is lost per year.Brain atrophy: Introduction. Brain atrophy: A condition which is characterized by a diminution in the size of the brain. See detailed information below for a list of 96 causes of Brain atrophy, Symptom Checker, including diseases and drug side effect causes. Research the causes of these symptoms that are similar to, or related to, the symptom Brain atrophy: 1  Brain injury. 2  Head injury (3 causes). 3  Mental retardation (2098 causes). 4  Arteriosclerosis (13 causes). 5  Alzheimer's disease (2 causes). 6  Encephalitis (137 causes). 7  Huntington's disease (2 causes). 8  Pick's disease.
How to price roof cleaning jobs	Roof Cleaning Average Costs. The actual cost of roof cleaning depends on your location, the complexity of the job (i.e. roof size and pitch and the height of your home), and other factors. The following prices are only general estimates. 1  On average, roof cleaning pricing is $.15 to $.30 per square foot, or $15 to $30 per square (a square, in roofing terminology, is equal to 100 square feet). 2  For an average-sized roof of 1,500 square feet (15 squares), that s a total cost of approximately $250 to $500. Roof Cleaning Basics. The stains on your roof are probably caused by a type of algae known as Gloeocapsa Magma. Transported through the air by spores, Gloeocapsa can grow on any type of roof in any climate, though it is more prevalent in the Gulf States and other areas with warm, humid climates.Where you live will directly affect the cost of cleaning your roof. If you live somewhere that your roof may be exposed to the elements, such as the beach or where it snows and sleets frequently, your professional may need to spend a little more time cleaning your roof to get all of the dirt, mold and grime off. The height of your roof may incur an additional cost. For example, if your home is three stories high, it takes a bit more work to get the professionals and equipment up there. Also if your roof is very steep, you might be charged extra for the professionals to get up there and stay safely on top of it.

what is the closest star to earth	Proxima is the closest star to Earth. Faint red Proxima Centauri – at only 3,100 K and 500 times less bright than our sun – is nearly a fifth of a light year from Alpha Centauri A and B. This great distance is what calls into question its status as part of a triple star system. Alpha Centauri is part of a double, or triple, star system. The two main components are Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. The third star, a red dwarf called Proxima Centauri, is thought to be about 4.22 light-years distant and is actually our sun’s closest neighbor among the stars.The closest star to us aside from the sun is Proxima, a small star that is part of the Alpha Centauri star system. On average, Proxima is 4.22 light years away while the star system as a whole is 4.27 light years away. The Sun is technically the closest star to the Earth. Besides that though, the star Alpha Centauri is closest. It is approximately 4.37 light years away The star closest to earth is the sun, averaging 93 million miles over the course of one full year. After the sun, the next nearest star is Proxima Centauri, roughly 270 thousand times farther from us than the sun is. Strictly speaking, the CLOSEST star to the Earth is our own Sun. The next closest after that is Proxima Centauri, a tiny red dwarf 4.2 light years away. Even though it is the … closest star to the Sun, it cannot be seen by the naked eye, because it is too dim!   The sun.
muscle responsible for most of the movement is called	There are many muscles that are responsible for primary body movements during exercise. They sometimes work in pairs; when one contracts, the opposite muscle stretches to allow a motion to occur. Other times, the muscle that causes a primary motion may part of a group of muscles that perform a similar function. The primary muscle is directly responsible for the movement while the others play an indirect, supporting role. It is not uncommon for one muscle to play an important role in more than one movement. There are also numerous muscles needed to move the torso during exercise to produce the full extent of movement in this region of the body. The erector spinae muscles of the back and the rectus abdominus of the front of the torso are primarily responsible for bending forward and backward.The muscle type responsible for body movements is skeletal muscle. This type of muscle is under voluntary control (unlike cardiac and smooth muscle) meaning that we can consciously control the movements we make. The specific skeletal muscle responsible for movement will depend on what movement is being made. That being said, the prime mover responsible for scapular depression is the trapezius (specifically the lower fibers). Other muscles which act as stabilizers or synergists in scapular depression and eventual scapular protraction are the subscapularis, the serratus anterior and the lower fibers of latissimus dorsi.
how much do football referees get paid	For the 2013-2014 the average NFL referee salary was $173,000. In 2014-2015, the referees earn an average of $10,500 per game (regular season, pre-season and playoff), which works out to $180,000 per year. By 2019, the average NFL salary will rise to $205,000. This season, a rookie NFL referee's salary starts at $78,000. A 10 year veteran can make as much as $200,000 per season. But here's the kicker (pun intended): NFL referees are not full time employees. They do not get paid time off and they do not receive health benefits. Even though NFL refereeing is a highly paid side job, most officials have full time jobs outside of Football. A veteran baseball umpire can make as much as $400,000 per year and receives health insurance, paid time off and a full pension. The NFL has offered a contract that would raise the average NFL referee salary to $200,000 per season by 2018.Thus, NFL referees earn between approximately $2,100 and $7,500 per game. According to TheRichest.org, NBA referees earn an average salary between $100,000 and $300,000 annually as of 2011. Since NBA referees are full-time referees and work 82 games during the regular season, they earn approximately $3,300 per game. Referees work a total of 162 games. As such their per-game salary ranges between approximately $500 and $1,800 per game. Additionally, they receive four weeks of paid vacation, hotel accommodations and first-class air tickets.
juris doctorate degree	The Juris Doctor degree (J.D. or JD) or Doctor of Jurisprudence degree (D.Jur. or DJur) is a professional doctorate and first professional graduate degree in law. The degree is earned by completing law school in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other common law countries. Many who hold the degree of Juris Doctor are individuals who practice law and may choose to focus their practice on criminal law, tort, family law, corporate law, and/or a wide range of other areas. Until very recently, only law schools in the United States offered the Juris Doctor. Starting about 1997, universities in other countries began introducing the J.D. as a first professional degree in law, with differences appropriate to the legal systems of the countries in which these law schools are situated.Just to clarify, it is called a Juris Doctor, not a Juris Doctorate (which is an inexistent term, and which confusingly connotes a doctorate, e.g. J.S.D. or Ph.D.). (see http://www.law.umich.edu/connection/a2z/... Although it is a first degree IN LAW, a Juris Doctor degree is a post-graduate degree. It is not the very first degree that you get right after high school -- that is an undergraduate degree. In the countries where the Juris Doctor degree is offered (e.g. U.S. and Canada), one must first have an undergraduate degree in order to qualify to apply to a Juris Doctor degree. In some jurisdictions like Brazil, a law degree
how old were the tributes in the hunger games	1 Rue (Amandla Stenberg) is the District 11 female in the 74th Hunger Games. 2  She was the youngest of all the tributes in the games, being just 12 years old. 3  She scored a 7 in her individual training. 4  She survived the initial bloodbath, unusual for such a young tribute. 1 Clove (Isabelle Fuhrman) is the District 2 female in the 74th Hunger Games. 2  Clove was a member of the career pack and an expert with throwing knives. 3  She scored a 10 in her individual training, very common of a career tribute. 4  In the initial bloodbath, she was the first tribute who came close to killing KatnissTributes are residents of the 12 districts of Panem who are forced/volunteered to participate in an annual Hunger Games. Except in special cases, such as for Quarter Quells. Twenty-four children between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen at random. Every district must give two tributes, a girl and a boy. The circumstances may be different if it is a Quarter Quell, like the 50th Hunger Games. That year, each district had to send two boys and two girls to compete, thus providing a total of 48 tributes. Quarter Quells are special editions of Hunger Games that happened every quarter century, hence the name, Quarter Quell.. Each Quarter Quell had a certain theme that would cruelly remind the districts of their failure at rebellion. 1  In the first Quarter Quell, the tributes were not drawn randomly from the glass balls.
what kind of literary work is the canterbury tales	Intro. The Canterbury Tales is one of the best loved works in the history of English literature. Written in Middle English, the story follows a group of pilgrims who are travelling the long journey from London to Canterbury Cathedral. One of the reasons Chaucer is so important is that he made the decision to write in English and not French. In the centuries following the Norman invasion, French was the language spoken by those in power. The Canterbury Tales was one of the first major works in literature written in English. Chaucer began the tales in 1387 and continued until his death in 1400. No text in his own hand still exists, but a surprising number of copies survive from the 1500s-more than 80The Canterbury Tales (Middle English: Tales of Caunterbury) is a collection of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer. In 1386 Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of peace and then three years later in 1389 Clerk of the King's work. The Canterbury Tales were far from complete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the General Prologue, some thirty pilgrims are introduced. Chaucer's intention was to write two stories from the perspective of each pilgrim on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine. The Canterbury Tales although perhaps incomplete, it is revered as one of the most important works in all of British Literature

Blackheath is an area of south-east London, divided between the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Lewisham, located east of the town of Lewisham, and south of the town of Greenwich. Blackheath also gave its name to the first hockey club, established during the mid 19th century. However, Blackheath is perhaps most famous for founding the Blackheath Rugby Club in 1858, which is the oldest documented rugby club in England and located on Charlton Road.
what is one pascal	The pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure, internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength, defined as one newton per square metre. It is named after the French polymath Blaise Pascal. Common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1 hPa ≡ 100 Pa) which is equal to 1 mbar, the kilopascal (1 kPa ≡ 1000 Pa), the megapascal (1 MPa ≡ 1,000,000 Pa), and the gigapascal (1 GPa ≡ 1,000,000,000 Pa). The pascal is also equivalent to the SI unit of energy density, J/m 3. This applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurized gases, but also to the energy density of electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields. In measurements of sound pressure, or loudness of sound, one pascal is equal to 94 decibels SPL.Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: A pascal is a unit of pressure. It is defined as 1 N/m^2. The N stands for Newton, and it is defined as kg m/s^2 So the pascal would ultimately be kg/m s^2 1000 of these pascals is a kilopascal, and one kilopascal is approximately 1% of the atmospheric pressure near sea level. Hopefully that's what you were asking for, your question is a little vague. Report Abuse. Here's your definition of one pascal: When a force of ONE NEWTON acts on an area of ONE SQUARE METRE, the pressure produced is said to be 1 pascal. 1 Pa = 1 N / 1 m^2.

what is diclofenac diethylammonium	Where the two Voltarens differ is in how the diclofenac is included in each formulation. Voltaren Emulgel contains diclofenac diethylamine 1.16% while Voltaren Gel contains diclofenac sodium 1%. Diethylamine and sodium are salts that are attached to the diclofenac molecule, which aid in its absorption. Customers frequently ask us if the Voltaren Gel 1% found in the USA is the same as the Voltaren Emulgel 1.16% marketed in Canada and many other countries around the world. While they are not identical, both Voltaren Gel 1% and Voltaren Emulgel 1.16% contain the same active ingredient diclofenac. Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which helps with conditions involving pain and swelling – such as headaches and joint paiAlso, the clinical trials of VOLTAREN® GEL prohibited concomitant use of oral NSAIDS. There is systemic exposure to diclofenac following normal use of VOLTAREN® GEL, up to 6% of the systemic levels of a single oral dose of diclofenac sodium [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ]. Therefore, concomitant administration of VOLTAREN® GEL with oral NSAIDs or aspirin may result in increased adverse NSAID effects. Of these, 513 patients received VOLTAREN® GEL for osteoarthritis of the knee and 400 were treated for osteoarthritis of the hand. Additionally, 583 patients were exposed to VOLTAREN® GEL in an uncontrolled, open-label, long-term safety trial in osteoarthritis of the knee.
what happened when the euro was introduced	Use of the euro. The euro was launched on 1 January 1999, when it became the currency of more than 300 million people in Europe. For the first three years it was an invisible currency, only used for accounting purposes, e.g. in electronic payments. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced, at fixed conversion rates, the banknotes and coins of the national currencies like the Belgian franc and the Deutsche Mark. Today, euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in 19 of the 28 Member States of the European Union, including the overseas departments, territories and islands which are either part of, or associated with, euro area countries. These countries form the euro area.[Last update: 7-Dec-2001]. On January 1, 1999, eleven European countries have replaced their national currencies and introduced a single European currency, the euro. Today (December 2001) the euro is the official currency in 12 countries. Bills and coins of the national currencies will remain in circulation as subdenominations of the euro until January 1, 2002, when they will be exchanged against new euro coins and bills. The 15-nation European Parliament agreed that Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg will switch to the newly-created currency called the euro on January 1, 1999. Britain, Sweden, and Denmark have decided not to participate.
what causes subscapularis tightness	The subscapularis is part of the rotator cuff. It is the only muscle in the rotator cuff that has a large advantage in internal rotation. The muscle highlighted in red is the subscapularis muscle. As you can see, it is pretty well-nestled in there with the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior. The Rest of the Problem. There are a few things that complicate things with this seemingly simple issue. 1. Trigger Points. Yes, you’ve heard me rant and rave about trigger points. Here are the big ones in the subscapularis: Note that the referred pain is in the back of the shoulder. If you have trigger points in your subscapularis, any number of things could be going wrong and causing you pain. A tight subscapularis usually manifests itself in pain in the back of the shoulder and a general feeling of tightness in the armpitThese forces cause disc degeneration, head and neck pain, rotator cuff impingement, amongst other problems. Regular shoulder stretches can improve posture, improve function, and make us feel and look younger. For a lot of us stress in our lives is manifested by tightness and hyperactivity of our shoulder muscles. Grab your right forearm and bring your hand down toward the floor. Be gentle and repeat after holding for the appropriate time. Posterior joint capsule tightness is often a cause of an anteriorly situated humeral head. This can cause subacromial impingement, tendinitis and bursitis.
How do I measure a ceiling fan for replacement	The ceiling fan you install should be the right size for the room: 1  Rooms that measure about 75 square feet need a fan with a 29- to 36-inch blade diameter. 2  For rooms measuring 76 to 144 square feet, choose a fan with a blade diameter of 36 to 42 inches. 1 For rooms measuring 76 to 144 square feet, choose a fan with a blade diameter of 36 to 42 inches. 2  If the room size is 144 to 225 square feet, select a fan with a 44-inch blade diameter. 3  For rooms that are 225 to 400 square feet, use a fan with a blade diameter of 50 to 54 inches.When shopping for ceiling fans, be aware that some ceiling fans have different blade options which will change the size or blade span of the fan. Sometimes, the blades themselves will have a length attributed to them that a consumer may think is the actual blade span when it is actually the length of the blade. Best Answer: The size of a ceiling fan as stated by ceiling fan manufactures is generally considered the overall diameter of the blade sweep which they call blade span. The best way to measure blade span is to measure from the center of the fan to the tip of one of the blades, which will give you the radius. Multiply that x 2 and you have the size or blade span of the fan. Measuring from blade tip to blade tip only works of the fan has an even number of blades. Since most fans nowadays have either 3 or 5 blades, the radius measurement is more often necessary
what type of inheritance does haemochromatosis	Types 1, 2, and 3 hemochromatosis are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Type 4 hemochromatosis is distinguished by its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. With this type of inheritance, one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. Type 1, the most common form of the disorder, and type 4 (also called ferroportin disease) begin in adulthood. Men with type 1 or type 4 hemochromatosis typically develop symptoms between the ages of 40 and 60, and women usually develop symptoms after menopause. Type 2 hemochromatosis is a juvenile-onset disorder.In HFE (Type 1) haemochromatosis it is rare for iron to build up to a damaging level in childhood, and in fact it often does not happen for several decades. Children can however overload iron as a result of Type 2 (Juvenile) haemochromatosis. 1. Genetic haemochromatosis (GH) is a genetic disorder causing the body to absorb an excessive amount of iron from the diet: the iron is then deposited in various organs, mainly the liver, but also the heart, endocrine glands such as the pancreas, and joints. This is iron overload
what to eat with diverticulitis flare up	Diverticulosis occurs when little pockets, which are known as diverticula, form along the colon wall. When these pockets get inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. A flare-up of diverticulitis can include a variety of symptoms and, if severe enough, may require hospitalization. One symptom of a flare-up of diverticulitis is abdominal pain. The patient may feel sudden pain in the lower left part of the abdomen, according to MayoClinic.com. In some cases, the pain may start out as a mild one and then gradually increase over several days. Another symptom of a diverticulitis flare-up includes nausea and vomiting, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Severe nausea and vomiting with abdominal distension may suggest a more significant complication of diverticulitis, such as a bowel obstruction.Fortunately, sufferers can find relief by eating the right foods. A low-residue diet, aka low-fiber diet, is usually recommended during the flare-up periods of diverticulitis to decrease bowel volume so that the infection can heal. An intake of less than 10 grams of fiber per day is generally considered a low-residue diverticulitis diet. Diverticulitis Diet. You may be asked to start with a clear fluid diet at the onset of diverticulitis. After a few days, you may incorporate the following low fiber foods (less than 10 g per serving) that are mild enough to be eaten during a diverticulitis flare-up.

the spleen has what type of tissue makes up	The spleen is found on the left side of your body, behind the stomach on a level with the 9th to 11th ribs. It is similar in structure to a lymph node, and is the largest lymphatic organ in the body. The spleen contains two main types of tissue-white pulp and red pulp. White pulp is lymphatic tissue (material which is part of the immune system) mainly made up of white blood cells. Red pulp is made up of venous sinuses (blood-filled cavities) and splenic cords. Splenic cords are special tissues which contain different types of red and white blood cells. Blood flows into the spleen where it enters the white pulp. Here, white blood cells called B and T cells screen the blood flowing through. The spleen is an organ about the size of a clenched fist found on the left-hand side of your upper abdomen. Its main functions are to filter your blood, create new blood cells and store platelets. It is also a key part of your body's immune system.There two main types of tissue in the spleen are specialised for its two main functions: White pulp contains lymphoid aggregations, mostly lymphocytes, and macrophages which are arranged around the arteries. The lymphocytes are both T (mainly T-helper) and B-cells. The spleen is the largest mass of lymphatic tissue in the bod, and is found between stomach and diaphragm. Like the lymph nodes, it also has a hilus (hilium) which is where the major blood vessels enter and leave.
what is northern territory landmarks	1 It is located in the southwest corner of the state and is named for the Uluru/Ayers Rock. 2  Uluru/Ayers Rock is the largest sandstone monolith in the world. 3  It is a sacred site of the Anangu Aborigines. 4  Alice Springs – Alice Springs is the primary city of the southernmost region of the Northern Territory. Australia’s Northern Territory is rich in history and is one of the most beautiful destinations in the world. Visitors to the Northern Territory can choose from five regions that make up this state, which is sparsely populated but filled with natural wonders. Rivers – The oldest river system in the world, the Finke River, is located in the Northern Territory. 2  Other river systems in the state include the Adelaide River, Alligator River, Daly River, McArthur River, Roper River and Victoria River. 3  Desert – The Simpson Desert is about the size of Europe.Darwin is the largest city in the Northern Territory, with a population of approximately 70,000 people, and is Australia's northern gateway. Darwin was settled to stop the French and Dutch gaining a foothold in Australia and was settled in 1864. Along with the red deserts, the Northern Territory is home to many of Australia's spectacular national parks. One beautiful example is Kakadu National Park which will expose a visitor to much of the Northern Territory's rugged landscape and wildlife such as eagles, giant lizards, crocodiles and emus.
how long off work for recovery knee replacement	The average short-term recovery time for a total knee replacement is 6 to 12 weeks. Long-term recovery involves the complete healing of surgical wounds and internal soft tissues. When a patient can return to work and the activities of daily living, they are on the way to achieving the full term of recovery. Another indicator is when the patient finally feel s normal again. The average long-term recovery for total knee replacement patients is between 3 and 6 months. Generally speaking, knee replacement patients take longer to recover than, say, hip replacement patients. It should still be noted, however, that recovery time for a total knee replacement can differ vastly from patient to patient. Some patients may take six months to recover; while others may recover in one month.When you can return to work after total knee replacement surgery depends on your profession. If your work is sedentary, you may return as early as 2 to 4 weeks post-operatively. If your work is more rigorous, you may require up to 3 months before you can return to full duty. In some cases, more time may be necessary. In most cases, however, you will likely use a walker or crutches for 2 to 4 weeks after your operation. You will then advance to a cane and wean to no assistive device at all. You will gradually return to normal function without any assistive devices. In general, most patients are close to full recovery after 3 months.
what does a broken rib feel like	A rib fracture is a crack or break in one of the bones of the rib cage. A break in the thick tissue (cartilage) that connects the ribs to the breastbone may also be called a fractured rib, even if the bone itself is not broken. The most common cause of a fractured rib is a direct blow to the chest, often from a car accident or a fall. Coughing hard can also fracture a rib. This is more likely to happen if you have a disease that has made your bones weak, such as osteoporosis or cancer. A common injury when you have a fractured rib is a punctured or collapsed lung (pneumothorax). Flail chest is a serious problem that happens when three or more ribs are broken in more than one place. If you have flail chest, the broken area can't hold its shape when you take a breath.Ribs that are fractured, broken or bruised will feel painful every time you breathe in or cough. This may make you feel like you can only take shallow breaths. You may also experience swelling or tenderness around the injured area, as well as bruising to the skin. A broken rib, cracked rib or fractured rib is a crack or break in one of the bones in the rib cage. The usual cause of a cracked rib is a blow to the chest, which might be sustained by a fall or as a result of a car accident. A broken rib could also be caused by severe coughing, although this is more likely if there is weakness in the ribs caused by a bone disease like osteoporosis
the opening through which the spinal cord exits the cranial cavity	The brain is housed in the hard and bony cranial cavity of the skull. The opening at the base of the skull through which the medulla oblongata, an extension of the spinal cord, exits the skull is known as the foramen magnum. It is one opening for brain tissue to protrude through. The brain is covered by the meninges, which comprise three layers – pia, arachnoid and dura mater. A less commonly seen cerebellar herniation is the upward cerebellar herniation (5) where pressure from the back of the cranial cavity pushes the cerebellar tissue upwards. An extracranial herniation (4) is when the brain tissue pushes through an opening in the cranial cavity formed by trauma or at a surgical site.The foramen magnum (Latin: great hole) is a large opening in the occipital bone of the human skull. It is one of the several oval or circular openings (foramina) in the base of the skull. The spinal cord, an extension of the medulla, passes through the foramen magnum as it exits the cranial vault. The opisthion is the midpoint on the posterior margin of the foramen magnum and is a cephalometric landmark. Another landmark is the basion located at the midpoint on the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. The foramen magnum is a very important feature in bipedal mammals. One of the attributes of a bipedal animal’s foramen magnum is a forward shift of the anterior border; this is caused by the shortening of the cranial base
cooking time for prime rib roast	Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 1 hour 45 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour 30 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°. 4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rareSear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast. Prime Rib Roast (standing rib roast), at room temperature (very important) 2 tablespoons butter, room temperature. Preparation: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Pat the room-temperature standing rib roast (prime rib roast) dry with paper towels or napkins. Smear the cut ends only of the roast with the butter.

what did the phonograph used to record	Answer by Aritchison. Confidence votes 675. The phonograph was a device used to record and replay sounds from a cylinder, or later from a vinyl disc (record). As with the modern versions, the CD and DVD, the record rotated on the player. A phonograph works by collecting sound in a horn that is attached to a diaphragm. The sound causes vibrations in the air that travel down the horn causing the diaphragm to vib … rate. The diaphragm is connected to a stylus and pressed into a cylinder covered in wax (or alternatively a thin layer of tin foil).The output side of the machine played the sound through a needle and an amplifier. The needle was set in the groove and the cylinder set to the beginning. The amplified vibrations played back the recorded sounds. The recording medium used in the original phonograph was awkward to use and broke easily. In 1887, Emile Berliner, a German living in America, developed a hand-cranked machine that turned a hard rubber disc on a flat plate (instead of a cylinder) which became known as the gramophone. With his understanding of how sound waves behave, Thomas Edison developed the phonograph, the grandfather of modern record players, in 1877. The phonograph could record sound and play it back. The receiver consisted of a tin foil wrapped cylinder and a very thin membrane, called a diaphragm, attached to a needle. Sound waves were directed into the diaphragm, making it vibrat
what does carriage include	A carriage is a wheeled vehicle for people, usually horse-drawn; litters (palanquins) and sedan chairs are excluded, since they are wheelless vehicles. The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use and for comfort or elegance, though some are also used to transport goods. It may be light, smart and fast or heavy, large and comfortable. Carriages normally have suspension using leaf springs, elliptical springs (in the 19th century) or leather strapping. A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage – terms for such include stagecoach, charabanc and omnibus.Carriage outwards is the shipping and handling costs incurred by a company that is shipping goods to a customer. The company may be able to bill customers for this cost; if not, then the company should charge the cost to expense in the period incurred. Carriage refers to the cost of transporting goods into a business from a supplier, as well as the cost of transporting goods from a business to its customers. Carriage inwards is the shipping and handling costs incurred by a company that is receiving goods from suppliers. The most appropriate accounting treatment of carriage inwards is to include it in the overhead cost pool that is allocated to the goods produced in an accounting period. If this is a minor amount, it could just be charged to expense in the period incurred, with no inclusion in the overhead cost pool
what is a refraction test	A refraction test is usually given as part of a routine eye examination. It may also be called a vision test. This test tells your eye doctor exactly what prescription you need in your glasses or contact lenses. Normally, a value of 20/20 is considered to be optimum, or perfect vision. Your doctor may also do this test without the help of a machine. In this case, he or she shines a light into each of your eyes and looks at the amount of light that is bouncing off your retina to measure your refractive score. Afterwards, your doctor will need to determine exactly what prescription you need.This test is performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Both of these professionals are often called eye doctor.. You sit in a chair that has a special device (called a phoroptor or refractor) attached to it. You look through the device and focus on an eye chart 20 feet away. The device contains lenses of different strengths that can be moved into your view. The test is performed one eye at a time. The eye doctor performing the test will ask if the chart appears more or less clear when different lenses are in place. If your uncorrected vision (without glasses or contact lenses) is normal, then the refractive error is zero (plano) and your vision should be 20/20. A value of 20/20 is normal vision. This means you can read 3/8-inch letters at 20 feet. A small type size is also used to determine normal near vision.
how many horsepower needed to plane a flat bottom boat	If you fish with 3 or more people and wish to get up on plane you should go with no less than a 20 hp outboard. Performance.

how whiskey is made	The type of grain used varies with the kind of whiskey being made, but all whiskeys contain at least a small amount of malted barley, which is needed to start the fermentation process. Scotch malt whiskey contains only barley. Other whiskeys contain barley in combination with corn, wheat, oats, and/or rye. 1 Whiskey is aged in wooden barrels, usually made from charred white oak. 2  White oak is used because it is one of the few woods that can hold a liquid without leaking but which also allows the water in the whiskey to move back and forth within the pores of the wood, which helps to add flavor.Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize) , rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.

what is a gooseberry pie	Gooseberry pie is a pie that is comprised of a traditional pie crust and a fruit filling of gooseberries mixed with sugar. Gooseberries are native to Europe, northwestern Africa and southwestern Asia. They usually are hairy and green, although they occasionally can be found in smooth and red or purple varieties as well.

typical cost of knee replacement surgery	The average hospital charge for a total knee replacement (TKR) in the United States is $49,500. A partial knee replacement (PKR) typically costs about 10 to 20 percent less than a TKR. The main reason is that the operation requires a shorter hospital stay. For example: an average of 2.3 days, compared to 3.4 days. Keep in mind that hospital charges don’t reflect the amount you pay out of pocket. The cost of a knee replacement can vary substantially, even within the same geographical area. The final hospital charge depends on many factors, including: 1  number of days spent in the hospital: This will vary depending on the type of knee replacement you have (total, partial, or bilateral).If you don’t have insurance and will be paying for your knee replacement, it’s wise to research knee replacement costs. The United States is known for wide variation in healthcare costs. The average national price for a knee replacement in 2012 was about $20,000 plus the cost of the implant. Implants can cost up to $10,000. Your choice of hospital or operating facility can be the biggest factor in the cost of your knee replacement. The amount you will pay out-of-pocket for knee replacement surgery depends on insurance coverage. Even if your insurance covers knee replacement, you will likely need to pay part of the cost. Ask your insurance provider about your costs—copays, deductibles and co-insurance—for your surgery.

The Harlem Renaissance was considered to be a rebirth of African American arts. Christianity played a major role in the Harlem Renaissance. Many of the writers and social critics discussed the role of Christianity in African–American lives. For example, a famous poem by Langston Hughes, Madam and the Minister, reflects the temperature and mood towards religionWilliam Shakespeare actually had several patrons over his career. The obvious patrons are the rulers during his career--Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. Generally, the ruling bodies of a society will be the major patrons of the art. (Answer #1). William Shakespeare actually had several patrons over his career. The obvious patrons are the rulers during his career--Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. Generally, the ruling bodies of a society will be the major patrons of the art. His most famous patron was the Earl of Southampton, Henry Wriothesley. Many believe that the Earl of Southampton is the “Dark Lady” that Shakespeare wrote certain sonnets for. Finally, William Herbert, the Earl of Pembroke, was his last patron.

how to calculate protein requirement for a horse	1 Weanlings weighing 550 pounds need about 1.6 pounds of protein. 2  Because these younger horses eat less grass or hay, grain can be increased to 7 pounds a day. 3  Yearlings weighing 850 pounds eat more grass or hay and require about 4.5 pounds of concentrate to bring protein intake to 1.75 pounds a day. Adult horses need protein only for repair and maintenance of body tissues, so their total requirement is fairly low. Many mature horses get all the protein they need (about 10% of the diet, on average) from grass or hay. Owners can confirm that this need is met by having pastures and hay analyzed.Although protein is listed as a percentage on feed tags, the National Research Council’s (NRC) latest recommendation for horses lists the protein requirement unit in grams. To understand how much protein to feed a horse, we need to do some math and further reading. Many people think that a 30 percent protein feed is way too much for a horse to handle. If one looks a little closer, the tag of Hubbard Life’s 30% Supplement indicates that a 1,100-pound horse should consume one pound per day. Thirty percent of one pound is 136 grams of protein. Average mixed hay is about 17 percent protein. Feeding 15 pounds of hay alone can deliver 1,157 grams of protein to a horse. Understanding the protein content and feeding rates of all the feed sources a horse has access to is key to achieving the proper protein ratio.
where is machu picchu on the map	It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru. It is situated on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Machu Picchu (in hispanicized spelling, [ˈmatʃu ˈpiktʃu]) or Machu Pikchu (Quechua machu old, old person, pikchu peak; mountain or prominence with a broad base which ends in sharp peaks, old peak, pronunciation [ˈmɑtʃu ˈpixtʃu]) is a 15th-century Inca site located 2,430 metres (7,970 ft) above sea level.The ancient Inca city is positioned in the Andes Mountains on a saddle between the mountains of Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu at 2450 m/8040 ft above sea level. The ruins are located about 13 degrees south of the equator and surrounded on three sides by a loop of the Urubamba River. Click here to see Machu Picchu packing guide. Machu Picchu is in the GMT-5 time zone and located in a natural cul-de-sac about 113 Km northeast of the city of Cusco. The other way to get to Machu Picchu is by foot on the Inca Trail. The 45 km hike takes 4-days and is only possible by hiring a licensed tour operator to buy the hiking permits for you. (also consider the easy 1-day Inca Trail hike) The operator provides guide, porters, equipment, meals and a tour of Machu Picchu.
do you keep olive oil in the refrigerator	5. Store some types of olive oil in the refrigerator. 1  Virgin olive oils and lower quality olive oils can be stored in the refrigerator. 2  The oil may turn cloudy and thicken, but will clear up and thin out when brought to room temperature. 3  Keep small amounts at room temperature for regular use. 1 Dark glass keeps the light out, allowing the oil to last longer. 2  Do not store your olive oil in plastic, because the PVC (polyvinyl chloride) from the plastic can be absorbed by the oil. 3  Avoid reactive metals such as copper or iron, because of potential chemical reactions that can make the oil unsafe.Refrigeration does not affect the quality or flavor of other olive oils. Olive oil will keep well if stored in a sealed container in a cool, dark cupboard for about one year. If unopened, the oil may keep for as long as two years. Unlike wine, oil does not improve with age. Returning it to room temperature restores its fluidity and color. Another option is to store olive oil in a wide-mouth glass jar in the refrigerator. Even though it solidifies, you can easily spoon out any amount you need. A clear jar is fine because it's dark inside the refrigerator most of the time. If you don't want to refrigerate your olive oil, keep it in a dark, cool cupboard away from the stove or other heat-producing appliances. Olive oil connoisseurs recommend storing premium extra-virgin olive oils at room temperatur
describe the dynastic cycle in china	According to this theory, each dynasty rises to a political, cultural, and economic peak and then, because of moral corruption, declines, loses the Mandate of Heaven, and falls, only to be replaced by a new dynasty. The cycle then repeats under a surface pattern of repetitive motifs.This theory sees a continuity in Chinese history from early times to the present by looking at the succession of empires or dynasties, implying that there is little basic development or change in social or economic structures.he dynastic cycle only came to the end with the establishment of Republican China in the early 20th century. Although this well-known dynastic periodization of China is more or less based on traditional Sinocentric ideology, it also applies to non-native rulers who sought to gain the Mandate of Heaven.The dynastic cycle only came to the end with the establishment of Republican China in the early 20th century.

what condition leads to rain	Hypothermia occurs when your body loses heat faster than it produces it. The most common causes of hypothermia are exposure to cold-weather conditions or cold water.But prolonged exposure to any environment colder than your body can lead to hypothermia if you aren't dressed appropriately or can't control the conditions.Specific conditions leading to hypothermia include:1  Wearing clothes that aren't warm enough for weather conditions. 2  Staying out in the cold too long.ut prolonged exposure to any environment colder than your body can lead to hypothermia if you aren't dressed appropriately or can't control the conditions. Specific conditions leading to hypothermia include: 1  Wearing clothes that aren't warm enough for weather conditions. 2  Staying out in the cold too long.Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitated —that is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.hen air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.
how do you know if you have wrinkles	Rona Berg, in her book, Beauty the New Basics, suggests you take the skin test to tell what skin type you have. To do this, wash your face, pat it dry, then take a few pieces of rice paper or lens-cleaning tissue paper and press on different spots on your face. If your skin is oily, the paper will stick, pick up oily spots and become translucent. If the paper doesn't stick or pick up any oily spots, your skin is likely dry. If it sticks in your t-zone (forehead, nose and chin) then you have combination (or normal) skin. Most women actually have combination skin. Here are the 5 different skin types and their tell-tale characteristicsSkin ages all over the body but much more so where there has been sun exposure. Changes brought on by sun damage (photoaging) include dryness (really roughness), sagginess, skin growths like keratoses, lentigos ( liver spots), and wrinkles. Most wrinkles associated with aging appear on the parts of the body where sun exposure is greatest. These especially include the hairless scalp, face, neck, the backs of the hands, and the tops of the forearms. Wrinkles come in two categories: fine surface lines and deep furrows. Many products and procedures promise to reduce wrinkles. Some do little or nothing (like the products that claim they reduce the appearance of fine lines, which means that they don't reduce the lines themselves). Others can achieve a fair amount of success.
recommended level of cholesterol intake	Optimal LDL levels are below 100 milligrams per deciliter, while good HDL levels are 60 milligrams per deciliter and above. And even though the recommended level of total cholesterol is less than 300 milligrams per deciliter a day, you should aim to keep your total cholesterol below 200 milligrams a day. Recommended Intake. Your body makes all the cholesterol needed for physiological functions, so getting cholesterol from your diet is unnecessary. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommend consuming less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day. Sticking to the recommended amount helps promote healthy cholesterol levels. You should get less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol per day if you have high cholesterol or other risk factors for heart diseaseDecreasing the amount of total fat, saturated fat, trans fats, and cholesterol you eat is a healthy first step. Diets low in saturated fats and cholesterol have been shown to decrease cholesterol levels. Saturated fat intake is the major dietary factor that affects cholesterol levels. Moderate weight loss is also beneficial in lowering elevated cholesterol levels. Five to ten pounds of weight lost can lower LDLs by as much as 5-10%. Fiber also helps lower cholesterol and is only found in plant-based foods like fruit, vegetables, beans, legumes, seeds, nuts and whole grains. It is recommended to eat 20-40 grams per day by the National Institute of Health.
what is a migraine headaches	Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by recurrent moderate to severe headaches often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms. The word is derived from the Greek ἡμικρανία (hemikrania), pain on one side of the head, from ἡμι- (hemi-), half, and κρανίον (kranion), skull. 1 Chronic migraine is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for migraine headache and occurs for a greater time interval. 2  Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.Not all headaches represent migraines, and migraine is not the only condition that can cause severe and debilitating headaches. For example, cluster headaches are very severe headaches that affect one side of the head in a recurrent manner (occurring in a cluster over time). The pain is sometimes described as drilling, and can be worse than migraine pain in some cases. Cluster headaches are less common than migraine. Tension headaches are a more common cause of headache. Thee occur due to contraction of the muscles of the scalp, face, and neck. In addition, many patients experience nausea or vomiting. The headache of a migraine often involves only one side of the head but in some cases, patients may experience pain bilaterally or on both sides. The pain of a migraine is often described as throbbing or pounding and it may be made worse with physical exertion.
characteristics of oceanic crust gcse	This usually involves a continental plate and an oceanic plate. The oceanic plate is denser than the continental plate so, as they move together, the oceanic plate is forced underneath the continental plate. The point at which this happens is called the subduction zone. As the oceanic plate is forced below the continental plate it melts to form magma and earthquakes are triggered. The magma collects to form a magma chamber [magma chamber: A region under the surface of the Earth where hot molten magma collects. ] . This magma then rises up through cracks in the continental crust. As pressure builds up, a volcanic eruption may occur. The diagram below shows how the oceanic plate is pushed underneath the continental plate, causing mountains and possibly volcanoes to form along the destructive plate boundary.Oceanic crust is the part of the Earth's crust that makes up the seafloor. It's thinner, denser, and simpler in structure than the continental crust. Oceanic crust is also younger, on average; from its birth at a mid-ocean ridge to its end at a subduction zone is no more than 250 million years. A term that is sometimes used for oceanic crust rocks is sima, which is short for magnesium silicate, a common component of these rocks. Another term for these undersea igneous rocks is mafic, which comes from the fact that they are high in magnesium and iron. Basalt and gabbro are examples of mafic rocks.

In manufacturing, ginger is used as for fragrance in soaps and cosmetics. One of the chemicals in ginger is also used as an ingredient in laxative, anti-gas, and antacid medications.Ginger's root contains chemicals called gingerols and shogaols. When using ginger to treat upset stomach, these chemicals relax the intestinal tract, preventing motion sickness and relieving the nausea, vomiting, colicky stomach cramps, and diarrhea that often accompany stomach flu.This herb has been studied as a remedy for motion sickness.inger appears to reduce inflammation in a similar way to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen; it slows associated biochemical pathways. Ginger is also a mild stimulant that promotes circulation.
what are tumor stromal cells	Sex cord-stromal tumors include granulosa cell tumors (which differentiate toward female characteristics), fibroma-thecomas, and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (which differentiate toward male characteristics). Granulosa-stromal cell tumors include granulosa cell tumors, thecomas, and fibromas [ 3 ]. They account for 70 percent of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors. Among granulosa-stromal cell tumors, fibromas are the most common histology. These tumors occur with equal frequency among pre-and postmenopausal women. Stromal cells are connective tissue cells of any organ, for example in the uterine mucosa (endometrium), prostate, bone marrow, and the ovary. They are cells that support the function of the parenchymal cells of that organ. Fibroblasts and pericytes are among the most common types of stromal cells. The interaction between stromal cells and tumor cells is known to play a major role in cancer growth and progression. In addition, by regulating locally cytokine networks (e.g. M-CSF, LIF), bone marrow stromal cells have been described to be involved in human haematopoiesis and inflammatory processes. Certain types of skin cancers (basal cell carcinomas) cannot spread throughout the body because the cancer cells require nearby stromal cells to continue their division. The loss of these stromal growth factors when the cancer moves throughout the body prevents the cancer from invading other organs.
nhl salary cap definition	In sports, a salary cap is a preset limit on the amount of money that teams can spend on player salaries over the course of one year. There are two forms of salary caps-a hard cap and a soft cap. A hard cap, which is used by leagues such as the NFL and NHL, means that teams can not spend above a certain amount or else they will be subject to potentially severe sanctions. A soft cap, on the other hand, is when teams are allowed to spend above a certain amount if they are willing to incur a financial penalty (usually known as a luxury tax). Both Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) employ soft caps with luxury taxes.The lockout was resolved when the NHLPA agreed to a hard salary cap based on league revenues, although the NHL reciprocated by implementing revenue sharing which would allow for a higher cap figure. The NHL salary cap is formally titled the Upper Limit of the Payroll Range in the new CBA. For the 2005–06 NHL season, the salary cap was set at US$ 39 million per team, with a maximum of $7.8 million (20% of the team's cap) for a player. The 1994–95 NHL lockout was fought over the issue of the salary cap. The 1994–95 season was only partially cancelled, with 48 games and the playoffs eventually being played. Although, at the time, six NHL franchises were based in Canada, by the turn of the century nearly all NHL salaries were being paid in U.S. dollars.

normal range for mchc blood test	Indications/Applications. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) laboratory test, as part of a standard complete blood count (CBC), is used along with other RBC indices (MCH and MCHC) to help classify the cause of anemia based on red cell morphology. See also the Interpretation section above. MCV is elevated or decreased in accordance with average red cell size; ie, low MCV indicates microcytic (small average RBC size), normal MCV indicates normocytic (normal average RBC size), and high MCV indicates macrocytic (large average RBC size). The reference range for MCV is 80-96 fL/red cell in adult.A MCHC test is a test that is carried out to test a person for anemia. The MCHC in a MCHC test stands for Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration. MCHC is the calculation of the average hemoglobin inside a red blood cell. A MCHC test can be performed along with a MCV test (Mean Corpuscular Volume). Both levels are used to test people for anemia. The MCHC test is also known as the MCH blood test which tests the levels of hemoglobin in the blood. The MCHC test can be ordered as part of a complete blood count (CBC) test. MCHC is measured in grams per deciliter. Normal readings for MCHC are 31 grams per deciliter to 35 grams per deciliter. A MCHC blood test may be ordered when a person is showing signs of fatigue or weakness, when there is an infection, is bleeding or bruising easily or when there is an inflammation.
how do you define presidential character	James David Barber James Barber differentiates between four types of presidential character: active-positive; active-negative; passive-positive; and passive-negative. Before voters cast their ballots for president, they should know how active the candidate is and whether or not he or she truly enjoys political life. This allows voters to predict presidential performance before the candidate takes office. James David Barber. Source: Presidential Character and How to Foresee It, chapter 1 of The Presidential Character: Predicting Performance in the White House, 4th ed., by James David Barber, pp. 1-1 1, 493. 1992.However, the U.S. Constitution limits the President&#39s power to act. Only Congress can pass legislation, and Congress sometimes moves slowly. The President can only approve or veto (reject) legislation that Congress passes. Even then, Congress can override a veto and make it the law. How can voters be sure that a candidate will hold up during those kinds of pressure situations? The short answer is that they can&#39t. Even so, a candidate&#39s character often gives clues as to how the person will react under stress. People disagree about what character traits are most important in a President. But there are some commonly accepted things that people look for, such as integrity, strength, and caring. Experts say that adult experiences can be just as important in shaping a future President
what muscle is innervated by the dorsal rami	Branches of the cervical plexus, which include the phrenic nerve, innervate muscles of the neck, the diaphragm, and the skin of the neck and upper chest. The brachial plexus contains anterior rami from spinal nerves C5-T1. This plexus innervates the pectoral girdle and upper limb. Shortly after a spinal nerve exits the intervertebral foramen, it branches into the dorsal ramus, ventral ramus, and rami communicantes. Each of these latter three structures carries both sensory and motor information.The posterior ramus of spinal nerve (or posterior primary division) refers to the posterior division of a spinal nerve. The ramus is also known by a number of other names, posterior (or dorsal) rami (or branches or divisions) of the spinal nerves. The posterior ramus is one of two major branches of a spinal nerve that emerge after the nerve emerges from the intervertebral foramen. The posterior ramus carries information that supplies muscles and sensation to the human back. Because each spinal nerve carries both sensory and motor information, spinal nerves are referred to as “mixed nerves.. Posterior rami carry visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from the skin and deep muscles of the back. The posterior rami remain distinct from each other, and each innervates a narrow strip of skin and muscle along the back, more or less at the level from which the ramus leaves the spinal nerve
how was the netherlands geologically formed	1 LOCATION AND SIZE. The Netherlands (formerly also known as Holland) is located in Western Europe between Belgium and Germany, bordering the North Sea. With an area of about 41,526 square kilometers (16,033 square miles), the country is slightly less than twice the size of the state of New Jersey. The North Sea coastline of the Netherlands consists mostly of dunes. The low-lying sandy dunes of the northwestern coastline were created by the action of wind and water. In some areas, they are nearly 30 meters (100 feet) high. Further south, the major rivers flow into the North Sea and form the delta region.The geology of the Netherlands describes the geological sequence of the Netherlands. Large parts of the Netherlands today are below sea level and have in the past been covered by the sea or flooded at regular intervals. The modern Netherlands formed as a result of the interplay of the four main rivers (Rhine, Meuse, Schelde and IJssel) and the influence of the North Sea. The Netherlands is mostly composed of deltaic, coastal and eolian derived sediments during the Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods. Fairly all of the west Netherlands is composed of the Rhine-Meuse river estuary, but human intervention greatly modified the natural processes at work. Most of the western Netherlands is below sea level due to the human process of turning standing bodies of water into usable land, a polder.
why does talking to plants help them grow	As with the case of plant responses to different types of music being played, there's no definitive answer to whether plants grow faster because they're being talked to. The idea appears to be that plants may grow faster if people talk to them at close range. The reason tends to be twofold. One is that people expel carbon dioxide when they talk. Plants take in CO2, and release oxygen, as part of photosynthesis. So more CO2 helps photosynthesis, which leads to more energy reserves for plant activities, and therefore improved plant health. Actually, for carbon dioxide to even begin to affect the plant, you would have to talk to it for at least seven hours a day. Most scientists believe the reason talking and music help plants is because of the vibrations caused by sound waves or the pitch at witch you speak.The best thing people can do to help their plants grow is provide them with light, water, and mineral nutrition, says Marini. While the studies suggest that sound may spur plants to faster growth, there is no definitive evidence that a gift of gab will turn you into a green thumb. Regarding why plants would have evolved to respond to vibration in the first place, Marini speculates that it may have occurred as a way to help them survive in windy environments. Plants exposed to wind produce a growth-retardant hormone called ethylene, which causes the plant to be shorter and to have thicker stems
solar panel installation cost breakdown	Cost Of Solar Installation. The cost of solar installation has been and will continue to be a significant part of the total overall cost for a homeowner switching to solar power. The price that a typical homeowner has paid to get a non-leased, fair-priced solar panel system installed is approximately $1.00 per watt. This figure is only for a contractor’s solar installation service. For a typical 5,000 watt system this would be $5,000. Money from this figure goes towards an installer’s supply chain costs, labor, overhead, and profit margin. These numbers are, of course, averages. Some installers charge less, some more. As stated in the cost of solar page, the total cost of an installed solar panel system is $3.50 per watt, on average. So installation services are about one third of the total cost for someone who wants to go solarThese are the costs paid to the installers/electricians to connect solar panel systems and the balance of systems (BOS) to the grid or the customer installation.Solar Installations costs can vary between 10-20% of the total costs. Balance of Systems (BOS). Solar Inverter Costs. Solar Inverters cost around 50c/watt for small buyers of solar systems but can cost lower for large kilowatt inverter sizes and for scale buyers.Solar Inverters are a crucial component of a solar system and make up around 10% of the solar system costs.Here is a list of major solar inverter brands.

The town is located on the mainland opposite the southern end of World Heritage listed Fraser Island, which is only a few miles away and adjacent to Cooloola National Park. The closest cities to Tin Can Bay are Gympie and Maryborough.Tin Can Bay, Queensland. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Tin Can Bay is a town in the Wide Bay–Burnett region in Queensland, Australia. The seaside town is located on a deep but narrow sheltered inlet in the Gympie local government area, 218 kilometres (135 mi) north of the state capital, Brisbane. At the 2006 census, Tin Can Bay had a population of 1,994. It is suggested that the town's name derives from the indigenous word, Tuncanbar, thought to refer to the dugongs that frequent the inlet. European settlement began in the 1870s as the point where logs would be floated to the timber mills at Maryborough. Each September the town hosts the Tin Can Bay Seafood Festival [1] , a day of family fun, with entertainment, novelty competitions such as mullet throwing and prawn eating, helicopter joy flights over the bay, seafood and market stalls.

how was the canadian shield formed	The North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock. The Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called Arctica, which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the Neoarchean era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, Scotland, Siberia, and East Antarctica and is now roughly situated in the Arctic around the current North Pole. The lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation, but it also contains many marshes and bogs. The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with permafrost year round. Forests are not as dense in the north.The Canadian Shield region of Canada is a big region. It is the largest sub-region in the northern region of the country. It is 4.8-billon square km in area. It is located in … northeast Alberta, northern Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba, southern N.W.T, Ontario (except for the peninsula), Quebec and Labrador. Split and merge into it. Answer by Diana Christian. Confidence votes 92. Canadian Shield was formed when 2 tectonics plates collided, when they collided, folding occurred.

Modern Standard Hindi is one of the official languages of India. As of 2009, the best figure Ethnologue could find for speakers of actual Hindustani Hindi was 180 million in 1991. In the 2001 Indian census, 258 million (258,000,000) people in India reported Hindi to be their native language. However, this number includes tens of millions of people who are native speakers of related languages but who consider their speech to be a dialect of Hindi.

what range of temperature do live plants prefer to live at?	Once again, research the specific range your desired plants are able to tolerate. Water temperature-Though most aquatic plants do well within the temperature range of 70 to 80 degrees, there are several aquatic plants, such as Anacharis and Japanese Dwarf Rush, that prefer cooler water temperatures. Foster & Smith Educational Staff Anyone who has seen a photograph of a lush, verdant setup with a school of jewel-like tetras knows the beauty of a freshwater planted aquarium. But many hobbyists avoid adding live plants, believing they are too fragile or too difficult to keep.Water temperature-Though most aquatic plants do well within the temperature range of 70 to 80 degrees, there are several aquatic plants, such as Anacharis and Japanese Dwarf Rush, that prefer cooler water temperatures. Find out the particular temperature requirements of each plant first. Water parameters. Just like fish, live plants do best when they are kept in an aquarium that best suits their needs. Selecting live plants that share common water parameters will minimize problems and will make it easier for you to maintain ideal water conditions. The three main aspects to consider are pH, water hardness, and water temperature. pH-Most live plants are tolerant of a pH range between 6.5 and 7.5. However, some sensitive plants have a narrower pH tolerance so it is important to research the specific pH requirements of each plan

Medical expert witnesses are on average better compensated than non-medical expert witnesses. The average hourly fee for in court testimony for all non-medical experts is $248. The average hourly fee for in court testimony for all medical experts is $555. Medical expert witnesses on average earn more than double (124% more) what non-medical expert witnesses earn. 45% of all responding experts were medical experts and 55% of all responding experts were non-medical experts. The median hourly rate for all experts for in court testimony was $300. The median hourly rate for experts who have been testifying 1-5 years was $350 and the median hourly rate for experts who have been testifying 26+ years was $275. Expert Witness Fees for Trial, File Review and Depositions.If the amount is out of line, the judge or jury might just conclude that the expert is being paid more than usual in an effort to sway his or her testimony. For example, if a dentist typically generates fees of $150 per hour, s/he will generally charge something similar per hour for taking on a matter as an expert. (You'd probably conclude that the witness was being paid an extra $350 per hour in an effort to buy the testimony.) However, it is not all that unusual for the expert to be paid slightly more for appearing at trial, than doing ordinary office work.

saffron crocus how to grow	If saffron crocus is planted in swampy or poor draining soil, it will rot. Other than needing good soil and sun, saffron crocus are not picky. When you plant your saffron crocus bulbs, place them in the ground at about 3 to 5 inches deep and at least 6 inches apart. Before Growing Saffron Crocus. Saffron comes from the saffron crocus bulb (Crocus sativus), which is an autumn blooming crocus. The spice is actually the red stigmas of this crocus flower. Each flower will only produce three stigmas and each saffron crocus bulb will only produce one flower. When growing saffron, you need to first find a place to purchase the saffron crocus bulbs. Most people turn to a reputable online nursery to purchase them, though you may find them for sale at a small local nursery. It is highly unlikely that you will find them at a chain store or big box storeEach saffron crocus plant only produces three stigmas, which are used for the spice. Crocus sativus, commonly known as saffron crocus, is a delicate-looking lavender plant that produces sought-after stigmas. When harvested and dried, these stigmas create saffron, the most expensive spice in the world. Create a 3- to 6-inch-deep hole in the amended soil. Set the corm in the hole with the pointed side facing up. Cover the saffron corm with the soil and tamp the dirt lightly with the palm of your hand. Space each corm 4 inches apart. Water the bulbs deeply.
average legal fees for testamentary trust	• testamentary continuing trusts, from the time the trust is established, and. • all other trusts, from the date when the trust is committed to PTCo's administration. Example – a trust established in a client’s will (testamentary trust) with assets valued at $5,000,000. The annual fee charged is $68,750. Where PTCo previously administered the client’s estate an establishment fee is not payable. 3.30% of the gross value of assets of the estate over $1.000,000 up to $3,000,000. 2.20% of the gross value of assets of the estate over $3,000,000 up to $5,000,000. 1.65% of the gross value of assets of the estate over $5,000,000. A minimum capital fee of $19,800 applies. In certain circumstances an establishment fee may be negotiated when taking on administration of an estate as an agent for, or on behalf of, a named executorComments (2). A trust is a legal relationship which sets up a person or company (the trustee) to manage property for the benefit of another (the beneficiary). A trust is an estate-planning tool that can be used in addition to or instead of a will. Typical costs: 1 Having an estate planning attorney create a basic trust starts around $900-$1,500, but a situation requiring a bit more evaluation and planning can run $1,500-$3,500 or more, depending on the complexity and the extent of the assets involved. 2  Do-it-yourself living trust kits are available for anywhere from $25-$500.
how to avoid ua award change fees	The fee is $110 for award flights. There is no fee to change or cancel a flight ticketed within 24 hours, so long as the reservation was made at least 7 days prior to departure. United Airlines charges change fees of $200 for domestic flights and up to $400 or more for international itineraries. Frontier Airlines has a $75 change fee for paid Economy class tickets, but changes are free for those who pay extra for Classic Plus fares. Award tickets can be changed with no fee 8 days or more prior to departure; otherwise the $75 change fee applies. Hawaiian Airlines charges a $200 change fee for flights to the US mainland, and between $50 and $200 for international flights. There is also a $30 change fee for flights within the Hawaiian islandJetBlue Change and cancellation fees for both award and paid fares depend on the price of the ticket. Fares under $100 have a fee of $75, fares between $100 and $149.99 have a fee of $100, and fares of $150 and above have a $150 fee. Southwest has the friendliest change and cancellation policies among domestic airlines. Finally, you might not want to bother canceling an award at all sometimes. If the change fee is $200, and you have a one-way award that only cost 12,500 miles, then you might rather just forfeit the miles rather than buy them back at 1.6 cents each.

what kind of pot does a donkey tail plant grow well in	Transplant the growing donkey tail into successively larger pots as it grows, giving it just the next size pot -- for instance, from a 2-inch to a 3-inch pot. Put the plant into a hanging basket of the appropriate size once stems start becoming pendulous, with plants filling out the pots in two to five years.sually grown in hanging baskets, donkey tail needs careful handling because brittle stems break and the leaves detach easily. It grows in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 through 12. Native to cliffs in Veracruz, Mexico, donkey tail prefers partial shade and well-draining soil.I have been keeping this plant for years and it never seemed to grow fast. When I first bought this plant, I got it for 3 small cactus pots for RM10 - sort of like an offer price (3 for $10). TIPS: 1) Donkey's Tail is a succulent type of plant.It needs like any succulent or cactus plant care. 2) The leaves are beads shaped and they are quite fragile as they can easily snap off from the branch when brushed or touched. If the leaves spaced out from the branch-it means that its lacking sunlight.IPS: 1) Donkey's Tail is a succulent type of plant.

what are rare eye colors	It is a very rare eye color and also known as ‘wolf eyes’, since amber eye color is very common in wolves. Green. Green eye color is amongst the rarest eye color, with only 1-2% of the world's population born with green eyes. The reason for green eye color is the production of moderate amounts of melanin. Hazel eye color has also been defined as the medium-color between light brown and dark green. Hazel is common amongst people in America and Europe, while rare in African, Middle Eastern and Asian people. Gray. Gray eye color is considered to be a darker shade of blue (like blue-green). This eye color is related to low melanin in the iris and is related to scant pigmentation throughout the body (like pale skin, light hair, etc). Gray eyes have been found to reveal small amounts of yellow and brown color in the iris1 Green eye color is the most is not quite as rare as other colors as it is found throughout the world but is only in about 2 percent of the total world population. 2  This color is produced by a large amount of melanin in the iris during development, which is a result of genetics. 1 Amber-colored eyes consists of a golden or yellow pigment with a bit of copper and rust tint. 2  Lipochrome, the name of the yellow pigment, is extremely rare and as a result few people have this eye color. 3  Most often, red-colored eyes are found in humans who have pigment problems, such as albinos.
what is the function in humans of the protein produced from that gene	The KRT10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 10. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells called keratinocytes that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 10 is produced in keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). In the fluid-filled space inside these cells (the cytoplasm), the keratin 10 protein partners with a similar protein, keratin 1 (produced from the KRT1 gene), to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. epidermolytic hyperkeratosis-caused by mutations in the KRT10 gene. Dozens of mutations in the KRT10 gene have been found in people with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. This condition is characterized by red, blistering skin at an early age and thick skin (hyperkeratosis) later in life.Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3' .
what is nbr material	Nitrile rubber, also known as Buna-N, Perbunan, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, and NBR, is a synthetic rubber copolymer of acrylonitrile (ACN) and butadiene.Trade names include Nipol, Krynac and Europrene.Nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) is a family of unsaturated copolymers of 2-propenenitrile and various butadiene monomers (1,2-butadiene and 1,3-butadiene).ts resilience makes NBR a useful material for disposable lab, cleaning, and examination gloves. Nitrile rubber is more resistant than natural rubber to oils and acids, and has superior strength, but has inferior flexibility.The chemical name for Nitrile rubber is Butadiene Acrylonitrile. However, most commonly it is referred to as NBR or Buna-N. NBR is probably the most common solenoid valve seal material and it is considered the standard material for neutral fluids by many.NBR is also the standard material for O-rings.NBR can stand media temperatures to approximately 90 degrees Celsius on continuous basis, and higher temperatures intermittently.NBR resists aging caused by heat very well.

how to clear acne marks	Exfoliation. Wash your face with a gentle, oil-free cleanser specifically formulated for acne-prone skin. Apply the cleanser to an exfoliating pad and work in a circular motion every other day to encourage the shedding of damaged skin. Rinse your face and pat dry. Apply a mild salicylic acid solution.Salicylic acid works by preventing further breakouts and it gently exfoliates the top layer of skin. Apply a lightweight, noncomedogenic moisturizer with a sunscreen to protect your face from sunburn and over drying. In time, your acne scars will fade.ash your face with a gentle cleanser and rinse. Add the manufacturer's recommended amount of microdermabrasion cream to your face and work in a circular motion for two minutes with the handheld device or your fingertips. Do not apply too much pressure; allow the cream's ingredients to do the work.1 Post acne marks are dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation that don’t change the texture of the skin. 2  The best way to get rid of a post acne mark is to use a skin lightening treatment along with an exfoliating treatment.3  An acne scar causes an actual change in texture of the skin. post acne mark is an area of changed pigmentation that will appear darker on your skin. It doesn’t change the texture of your skin by creating a pit or pocked area. If you have dark spots on your skin without a change in texture, then you have a form of post acne marks.
which is better medigap or medicare advantage plan	A Medicare Advantage Health Plan (Medicare Part C) may provide more help at a lower cost than traditional Medicare plus Medigap. Instead of paying for Parts A, B and D, you enroll through a private insurance company that, in many cases, covers everything provided by Parts A, B and D and may offer additional services. It is illegal for an insurance company to sell you both a Medicare Advantage and a Medigap policy. Three things to consider before choosing which one to get: Cost: Medigap coverage usually has a higher monthly premium, but could result in lower out-of-pocket expenses than some Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans, on the other hand, generally cost less and cover more services, which can be the better option for your budget. Choice: Medicare Advantage plans generally limit you to the doctors and facilities within the HMO or PPO, and may or may not cover any out-of-network careNote: If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage health plan you cannot use a medigap policy to cover your out-of-pocket expenses; and it's illegal for an insurance company to sell you a medigap policy if you're enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. I've heard both described as insurance that is supplemental to Medicare. Q. What's the difference between a medigap plan and a. A. There are very big differences between these two types of insurance, although both are options for people with Medicare.
what happened in the evaporator coil	Causes of evaporator coil leaks that occur in the four-to seven-year time frame of an air conditioner’s service life – a much more common occurrence – most often are due to degradation of the copper tubing inside the coil. While there might be any number of other explanations for these problems, low refrigerant is high on the list, particularly with older air conditioners. The evaporator coil located inside the indoor air handler is a vital component in the air conditioning system. The coil circulates refrigerant vapor at a temperature of about 40 degrees. The refrigerant extracts heat energy from indoor air, which is drawn over the coil surfaces by the force of the blower fanComments are off. An experienced air conditioning technician looks for causes of evaporator coil leaks when tests reveal insufficient refrigerant in the system.

what does fixed costs mean	DEFINITION of 'Fixed Cost'. A cost that does not change with an increase or decrease in the amount of goods or services produced. Fixed costs are expenses that have to be paid by a company, independent of any business activity. It is one of the two components of the total cost of a good or service, along with variable cost. Next Up. An example of a fixed cost would be a company's lease on a building. If a company has to pay $10,000 each month to cover the cost of the lease but does not manufacture anything during the month, the lease payment is still due in full.Along with variable costs, fixed costs make up one of the two components of total cost: total cost is equal to fixed costs plus variable costs. In economics, fixed costs, indirect costs or overheads are business expenses that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business. They tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents being paid per month, and are often referred to as overhead costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related (and are paid per quantity produced). In management accounting, fixed costs are defined as expenses that do not change as a function of the activity of a business, within the relevant period. For example, a retailer must pay rent and utility bills irrespective of sales. In marketing, it is necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed
average cost to move an office	Moving day is only a small part of a business relocation. Comstock Images/Comstock/Getty Images. Many of the costs associated with relocating an office occur before and after moving day. Some of the costs will come in the form of labor to make internal and external changes and announcements. Some of the expenses will cover physical items and consulting fees as you prepare to shut down your old office and configure new space. Take into account the effects an office move will have on you and your clients as you budget for your move. Get quotes from office space brokers to gauge the cost of hiring a professional to negotiate your deal. Step 2. Choose the appropriate employee to plan all aspects of the move, including the pre-move, the actual move itself and the post-move.1 A move consultant, who helps plan the move, may charge $450 for a 1,500 office space to $3,000 for a 10,000-square feet one. 2  Long carries or shuttling boxes and equipment through elevators will take more time and cost extra. 3  Packing and reconnecting voice and data lines by an IT firm runs about $150 per hour. 1 Moving a large, 10,000 square-foot office starts around $5,000 and runs up to $30,000 for companies with numerous employees and workstations that need to be moved. 2  Office moves based on the truckload average $500-$1,500 per load depending on the time it takes to load, the difficulty and the number of movers.
cost of analgesia in piglets	In a paper delivered to the University of Guelph Swine Research Day entitled 'The effect of pain relief at castration and farrowing on piglet performance by S. Taylor, R. Friendship and G. Cassar, the subject of castration of piglets without the use of anaesthesia or analgesia was examined. Piglets were castrated 30 minutes after receiving the injection, and observations were made 10 minutes after castration for signs of discomfort. Piglets were weighed at 21 days of age, and mortality was recorded. In the sow study, sows were randomly assigned to a control group or a treatment group.The cost of analgesia was $0.22 per piglet and it did increase the time to castrate. The farrowing trial showed no differences between stillbirth rate, weaning weights or pre-weaning mortality between treated and control animals. The cost of Ketoprofen was 13.05/sow/dose. These preliminary data indicate no economic benefit from providing analgesia to sows at farrowing or to piglets at castration. Further analysis or further studies might show benefits to using analgesia where a small sow is delivering large piglets. Piglets were castrated 30 minutes after receiving the injection, and observations were made 10 minutes after castration for signs of discomfort. Piglets were weighed at 21 days of age, and mortality was recorded. In the sow study, sows were randomly assigned to a control group or a treatment group.

what are the lymphoid organs	Lymph is very similar to blood plasma: it contains lymphocytes and other white blood cells. It also contains waste products and debris of cells together with bacteria and protein. Associated organs composed of lymphoid tissue are the sites of lymphocyte production. Lymphocytes are concentrated in the lymph nodes. The spleen and the thymus are also lymphoid organs of the immune system. The tonsils are lymphoid organs that are also associated with the digestive system. Lymphoid tissues contain lymphocytes, and also contain other types of cells for support. The lymphatic system consists of lymphatic organs, a conducting network of lymphatic vessels, and the circulating lymph. The thymus and the bone marrow constitute the primary lymphoid organs involved in the production and early clonal selection of lymphocyte tissues.A fluid called lymph, (lymph = clear fluid) flows in lymphatic vessels, lymphatic tissue and red bone marrow. Fluid filters out of capillaries and drains into lymphatic vessels to become lymph. The content of lymph is the same as interstitial fluid, the fluid around tissue cells. Secondary lymphoid tissues are arranged as a series of filters monitoring the contents of the extracellular fluids, i.e. lymph, tissue fluid and blood. The lymphoid tissue filtering each of these fluids is arranged in different ways. Secondary lymphoid tissues are also where lymphocytes are activated.
how fast does lightning travel	According to scientist Bruce Steo, lightning moves at variable speeds. Lightning is in fact not light. But as the electronic plasma moves through charged air, it releases light waves. Depending on air conditions, the typical lightning bolt moves at 224,000 mph -- or about 3,700 miles per second. However, the light you see from the lightning obviously travels at the speed of light, which is roughly 670 million mph, or 186,000 miles per second. Which travels faster lightning or sound? Lightening travels at the speed of light, which is about 165,000 miles per hour, whereas sound, such as thunder, travels at the speed of sound in dry air, is approximately 1,1 … 27 feet per second or 768 mph (1,236 km/h) at 68°F (20 °C). Look in Wikipedia, under Thunder.Lightning is in fact not light. But as the electronic plasma moves through charged air, it releases light waves.

what is the best temperature to store wine	So, just to recap, red wines between 62-68 degrees optimal serving temperature, and white wines probably between 49-55 degrees. If you live in a house that is over 70 degrees, maybe put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before serving it, this is a red wine. And if you’re serving a white wine that you store in the fridge, maybe pull it out 30 minutes before you serve it. A lot of people have written us asking how to taste wine. If your wine is too cold, you won’t get any of the good stuff (or the bad… read: if it’s bad, cool it down) and if your wine is too hot is tastes like berries and sweaty laundry. View/Hide Video Transcript. Believe it or not the temperature of wine will effect the flavor…a lot. Here I have a wine at about 62-68 degrees.If you plan to use a single-zone refrigerator for your various red and white wines, a temperature of 54 degrees Fahrenheit is best. Although each version has a more ideal temperature setting, 54 degrees Fahrenheit will not adversely affect the wine and will slow down the aging process. Dual-zone wine refrigerators can store two types of wine at two different temperatures. Set one compartment at a temperature between 50 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit for red wine and set the other between 45 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit for white wine. Store red wines for up to ten years and white wines for up to three years. 1  Adjust the Temperature Gradually, When Necessary
when should hcg blood test be done	For confirming pregnancy, the timing of testing depends on how accurate a woman is about the day she expects her menstrual period as well as the method used for testing. In general, blood tests are more sensitive than urine tests and can be done two days before a woman would expect her period to start. A urine or blood hCG test can be done reliably by 10 days after a missed menstrual period. Even using a urine test, a woman may be able to determine whether she is pregnant the day she misses her period, but the result could be falsely negative. Occasionally, an hCG test is used to screen for pregnancy if a woman is to undergo a medical treatment, be placed on certain drugs, or have other testing, such as x-rays, that might harm the developing baby. This is usually done to help confirm that the woman is not pregnant.More sensitive tests, those that are able to detect a lower amount of hCG, can provide an accurate result as early as 7-10 days post ovulation. When deciding if you should use an HPT or have a blood pregnancy test done at the lab, here are a few items to consider: 1 (See the chart below for average blood hCG levels as pregnancy advances). 2  If hCG levels do not rise appropriately in those very early days, it can signal a problem with the pregnancy. 3  By monitoring your exact hCG levels with regular quantitative blood test, your doctor may be able to detect a problem early on.
what color are olives naturally	Olives naturally turn black as they ripen. When unripe they are green. As they ripen they get reddish, then purplish and finally black. Ripe Black Olives in a can are actually olives which are neither black nor ripe when they are picked. They are picked very green and then cured using dilute brine and lye solutions. Lye treatments cause natural phenolic compounds in the olives to oxidize to a black color. Calcium chloride salts, iron salts (ferrous gluconate) and compressed air bubbled through the curing vats help develop the black color. So there is no black dye used but the olives are treated to make them a nice uniform dark black. Home curing of olives without these added salts will result in mottled and brownish olives which taste just as good but are not as attractive. The opposite tact is used to make a nice green California-style green-ripe olive.Cool Hair Colors for Olive Skin. A true olive skin color is actually naturally cool in tone, so choosing a cool hair color will bring out the best features of your complexion. The following shades are perfect for a cool olive skin tone. Blondes: honey blondes, strawberry blondes, ash blondes and platinum blondes. Warm Hair Colors for Olive Skin. A warm hair color will pick up the golden, yellow undertones of your olive complexion and enhance them. When choosing a hair color, look for the following types of shades. Blondes: golden blondes.

negative effects of lsd	1 Bad trips. 2  A person using LSD may have a bad trip, even if they have taken LSD without negative effects in the past. 3  In a bad trip a person may see or feel frightening things. 4  It can lead a person to hurting him/herself or someone else. 5  A bad acid trip can last up to 12 hours. Every time people use LSD they are taking a risk, but many people don't know the LSD risks or don't think the negative effects of LSD use can happen to them. Keep reading to learn about some of LSD risks such as-bad lsd trips, acid flashbacks, mental damage, and more...LSD long term use and effects of such use vary depending on the person and the situation. Some users enjoy the experience, but others have bad trips, which cause fear and paranoia. A person who has previously enjoyed LSD may have a bad trip if they use it again or in a different situation. LSD long term use and effects can be very serious.

what is the melting point of rock	The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a solid is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at standard pressure. When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. The melting point of a pure substance is always higher and has a smaller range than the melting point of an impure substance or, more generally, of mixtures. The higher the quantity of other components, the lower the melting point and the broader will be the melting point range, often referred to as the pasty range.Melting Points of Rocks. Igneous rocks form through the crystallization of magma. There is a considerable range of melting temperatures for different compositions of magma. All the silicates are molten at about 1200°C and all are solid when cooled to about 600°C. Often the silicates are grouped as high, medium and low-melting point solids. The pattern shown above where different kinds of minerals crystallize at different temperatures is further developed in the Bowen reaction series. The crystallization temperatures play a large role in the development of the different kinds of igneous rocks upon the cooling of magma.
what phylum does a squid belong to	Squid belong to a class of animals known as Cephalopoda (cephalopods). This class includes the largest and most intelligent mollusks, including octopi, cuttlefish and the nautilus. The University of California Museum of Paleontology says 800 species of cephalopods have been identified. Phylum Mollusca: Soft and Plentiful. All squid species belong to the broad Animalia Kingdom. As the name implies, all animals belong to this kingdom. Members of this kingdom are multicellular and use other living things to supply their nourishment. Within that kingdom, squid belong to the narrower Mollusca phylum. Their phylum includes between 50,000 and 200,000 species, according to the University of California Museum of Paleontology. These soft-bodied creatures include slugs, scallops and clamsAt the seashore animals will be from the Animal Kingdom in these phyla. 1  Phylum: Mollusks (Soft-bodied animals that sometimes have a hard shell. 2  Includes: snails, octopus, squid, clams, oysters, and mussels.). 3  Phylum: Echinoderms (Often spiny animals, with several arms reaching out from the center of its body. 1 Includes: starfish, sea cucumbers and sea urchins.). 2  Phylum: Arthropods, SubPhylum: Crustaceans. 3  Crabs, lobsters, shrimp, barnacles and many other animals belong to the phylum arthropods. 4  In fact, 75% of all animals belong to the phylum arthropoda (which also includes spiders and insects).

what is it meant by the accounting equation	DEFINITION of 'Accounting Equation'. The equation that is the foundation of double entry accounting. The accounting equation displays that all assets are either financed by borrowing money or paying with the money of the company's shareholders. Thus, the accounting equation is: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity. The balance sheet is a complex display of this equation, showing that the total assets of a company are equal to the total of liabilities and shareholder equity. Any purchase or sale by an accounting equity has an equal effect on both sides of the equation, or offsetting effects on the same side of the equation. The accounting equation is also written as Liabilities = Assets – Shareholder Equity and Shareholder Equity = Assets – Liabilities. Next Up.The basic accounting equation, also called the balance sheet equation, represents the relationship between the assets, liabilities, and owner's equity of a business. It is the foundation for the double-entry bookkeeping system. For each transaction, the total debits equal the total credits. It can be expressed as. Now it shows owners' interest is equal to property (assets) minus debts (liabilities). Since in a corporation owners are shareholders, owner's interest is called shareholders' equity.

what is normal water pressure for a home	Normal Pressure Range. The normal range of water pressure in a residential application is between 40 psi and 80 psi. There is no specific rule about how much pressure is best for your house, since everyone's needs are different. However, anything below 40 psi will likely lead to poor performance of devices that use water. Anything higher than 80 psi could lead to damage, such as blown sprinkler heads or ruptured pipes. This device regulates how much pressure water is allowed to enter a home with. The regulator sits along the main water line, usually in an access panel, crawl space or basement. The regulator has a gauge on the top of the valve that points to how much pressure is coming through the pipe.You can correct high water pressure by installing a pressure reducing valve. This is a bell-shaped device that reduces the water pressure. Aim for water pressure that is 60-70 PSI. If the house has low pressure, you first want to determine if the house is on a public water supply system or a private well system. Most public systems are required to deliver a minimum of 30 PSI to your house, so inadequate pressure on public water systems is rare. This water pressure gauge shows slightly high pressure of 85 PSI. What they actually want to know is whether the flow from the showerhead will be strong enough for a quality shower, and whether someone flushing a toilet will interrupt that shower.

what theory did whorf come up with	Independently of Whorf and Sapir, Korzybski described the basic principle of his theory in a way that is a strong version of the hypothesis of linguistic relativity.he principle of linguistic relativity and the relation between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from philosophy to psychology and anthropology, and it has also inspired and colored works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages. Contents.The doctrine that language is the 'dress of thought' was fundamental in Neo-Classical literary theory (Abrams 1953, p. 290), but was rejected by the Romantics (ibid.; Stone 1967, Ch. 5). There is also a related view (held by behaviourists, for instance) that language and thought are identical.According to this stance thinking is entirely linguistic: there is no 'non-verbal thought', no 'translation' at all from thought to language. In this sense, thought is seen as completely determined by language.The Sapir-Whorf theory, named after the American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, is a mould theory of language.here is also a related view (held by behaviourists, for instance) that language and thought are identical. According to this stance thinking is entirely linguistic: there is no 'non-verbal thought', no 'translation' at all from thought to language.

what is an association area of the cerebral cortex	Association Cortex Association cortex is the cerebral cortex outside the primary areas (Figure 1). It is essential for mental functions that are more complex than detecting basic dimensions of sensory stimulation, for which primary sensory areas appear to be necessary. The surface area of the human cerebral cortex (and monkey's, dog's, and horse's as well) is further enlarged by the sulci and gyri shown by the curving lines on the cerebral hemispheres. Figure 1-2e. Primary and association cortical areas in human and rat. The pink area, which shows the association cortex, is much larger and also takes up a much larger percentage of cortex in the human than in the rat cerebral hemisphereIn the human brain more than two-thirds of the cerebral cortex is buried in the sulci. The cerebral cortex is gray matter, consisting mainly of cell bodies (with astrocytes being the most abundant cell type in the cortex as well as the human brain as a whole) and capillaries. The cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. The human cerebral cortex is 2 to 4 millimetres (0.079 to 0.157 in) thick. In large mammals, the cerebral cortex is folded, giving a much greater surface area in the confined volume of the skull. A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove or fissure is termed a sulcus (plural sulci)
what is average cost to replace windows	There is a huge range in window replacement costs -- anywhere from $100 at home depot to over a $1000 for a Pella casement window. The average replacement window cost is $300-$700 for a single window inserted into existing frames. This would equate to $3,000 to $10,000 for a home with about ten windows. A 30- by 48-inch window can range anywehere from $150 to $500. A low-end Harvey vinyl window could run you about $300, while a high-end brand like Pella or Anderson window could cost close to $1000 per window installed. For additional pricing estimates, check our replacement window cost estimator.A hopper window would replace an old steel framed single pane window. Depending on the situation, the steel frame could stay in place and act as a stop or something for the new window to butt up against. The average cost of a vinyl hopper replacement window is between $300-$400 per window. Now these window prices are based on my experience and the average cost of window replacement may vary slightly depending on the part of the country you live in. Three, vinyl is a very easy material to maintain. You do not need to paint vinyl windows and maintenance is just the act of cleaning the windows as you see fit. The average cost of a vinyl replacement window is between $400-$575 per window for a double hung. That price includes the cost of the new vinyl replacement window and the installation of it
what is atp-pcr system	The ATP-PC System. If you train any of your clients at high intensity you must understand how this energy system works. Here's a short(ish) explanation... As the name suggests the ATP-PC system consists of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PC). This energy system provides immediate energy through the breakdown of these stored high energy phosphates. If this energy system is 'fully stocked' it will provide energy for maximal intensity, short duration exercise for between10-15 seconds before it fatigues. There are only a few steps involved in the ATP-PC which is why it provides energy so quickly. S teps of the ATP-PC system: 1. Initially ATP stored in the myosin cross-bridges (microscopic contractile parts of muscle) is broken down to release energy for muscle contraction.Search. Known also as immediate energy system, phosphagen system, and alactic anaerobic system, the ATP – PCr system is the main energy provider for a high intensity exercise of short duration up to 10 seconds, for example lifting a weight, swinging a golf club, doing a push – up, and throwing a hammer. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of the body and when hydrolyzed, it releases a lot of energy that results in muscle contraction and protein synthesis. In fact, ATP is the stored form of energy readily available for the body to produce heat and energy when reacting with water.

where does avocado come from	The avocado (Persea americana) is a tree native to Mexico and Central America, classified in the flowering plant family Lauraceae along with cinnamon, camphor and bay laurel. Avocado or alligator pear also refers to the fruit, botanically a large berry that contains a single seed. Avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and Mediterranean climates throughout the world. They have a green-skinned, fleshy body that may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. Mexico produces most of the world's avocado, and avocado is one of the primary cultivars for export, the eighth cultivar by production volume. In 2013 the total area dedicated to avocado production was 168,155 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was of 1,109,814 tonnes.How to Make Avocado Oil. Avocado oil is a collection of the oil that has been extracted from the flesh of avocados. It is very aromatic and has multiple uses in culinary and cosmetic activities. However, as the avocado is a relatively expensive piece of fruit, purchasing avocado oil from a store can cost a significant amount. 1 Avocado oil may help prevent a number of cancers from developing. 2  The alpha linolenic acid in avocado oil has been shown to aid in the prevention of cancer, particularly breast cancer and colon cancer, while the vitamin E in avocado oil has been shown to both prevent and treat skin cancer and prostate cancer.
average pension amount in europe need	Average pension in Europe ranges from 250 to 1,500 euros per month, while 12.6 percent of pensioners below poverty level in 2013. Greece has 2.6 million pensioners receiving an average 882 euros per month. Portugal is close with 2.5 million pensioners who get 833 euros per month. In Spain, the average pension is 1,021, granted to 5.6 million pensioners. Pensions are significantly lower in eastern European countries. In Lithuania it is 242 euros per month, in Slovakia 408 euros and in Poland 504 euros. In France, the average pension was 1,032 euros last year for the 13.7 million pensioners of the private sector. By Philip Chrysopoulos -. Pensioners in Greece receive an average 882 euros per month, 713 euros from basic pension and 169 euros from supplementary pensions, while 12.4 percent live below poverty level, according to Eurostat figures.Private pension funds in OECD countries lost 24% of their value on average, worth USD 5.4 trillion. However, it is important to bear in mind that private pensions are only a part of the overall retirement-income package: a major part of retirement income is generally not affected by investment risk. By 2050, the average pensionable age in OECD countries will reach nearly 65 for both sexes: an increase of nearly 2.5 years for men and 4 years for women on 2010. However, life expectancy is projected to grow faster than these increases in pension age.

cedar chips outside for dog pee area	Re: Suggestions for kennel flooring. I use vinyl flooring over cement. And they start taking themselves outside at which time, I seriously limit the indoor area. But this was with summer litters, so outside was easy, especially with plenty of wood chips to keep them smelling fresh.I see in the dog magazines these puppy pens that are wire raised and have pans under them. My litters just couldn't stay in a 4'x4' area though.ddly, we've had some litters that preferred to sleep and play in the cedar chip filled whelping box and use the open exercise pen for the bathroom, and others that preferred to sleep and play in the exercise pen and used the cedar chips in the whelping area as a litterbox.Next, determine your size. My dog potty area measures 10 feet by 5 1/2 feet and is located by the garbage cans outside of my garage door. Very convenient. Use Stone for Proper Drainage: A dog potty area will contain a lot of urine in a very small area.Therefore, especially in areas where soil is clay, drainage is a necessity.We built our dog potty area using rock and gravel so that it can be hosed off easily and provide proper drainage.e used 12 bags of pea gravel as the top layer of the dog potty area. Let’s Begin: Excavate the area by skimming off the grass and first layer of topsoil. We dug in an area where there were a lot of gas lines and cable, so we only went down about an 1 1/2 to 2 inches.
how much do baseball referees get paid	A veteran baseball umpire can make as much as $400,000 per year and receives health insurance, paid time off and a full pension. The NFL has offered a contract that would raise the average NFL referee salary to $200,000 per season by 2018. In 2014-2015, the referees earn an average of $10,500 per game (regular season, pre-season and playoff), which works out to $180,000 per year. By 2019, the average NFL salary will rise to $205,000. This season, a rookie NFL referee's salary starts at $78,000. A 10 year veteran can make as much as $200,000 per season. But here's the kicker (pun intended): NFL referees are not full time employees. They do not get paid time off and they do not receive health benefits. Even though NFL refereeing is a highly paid side job, most officials have full time jobs outside of FootballBaseball umpires earn more money annually than the referees in the other three major American sports leagues, according to “Mental Floss,” a bimonthly magazine. NFL referees earn $25,000 to $70,000 per season, but they only work one game per week for the NFL season’s 17 weeks and can work another job during the week. NBA referees earn between $100,000 and $300,000 annually during an 82-game season. Lower levels of Minor League Baseball play in smaller cities. The Double-A leagues pay umpires $2,300 to $2,700 per month, while Class A full-season leagues pay $2,000 to $2,400 monthly.

how to place a trifecta	A trifecta is a popular exotic bet where you pick the first, second, and third place horses in a race. Because the odds are so against getting all three correct, the payout can be huge if you win.There are three trifecta bets: a straight trifecta, a trifecta box and a trifecta wheel.n a Trifecta box, you wager all combinations of 3 or more horses. For example, if making a $2 bet, you would need $2 for every possible combination.Trifecta Wagering. To place a Trifecta bet you must choose three horses that you believe will finish first, second and third. To win the bet, those three horses must finish in that order. A common way to play a Trifecta is to box three horses.A $1 trifecta box using #1,#2, and #3 would cost $6. The three horses you selected must finish in the top three spots for you to win. A four-horse $1 trifecta box would cost $24.Often a better way to play a trifecta is called a Trifecta key. In this wager you use one or more “key” horses. For instance if you liked the #1 to win, you could play a $1 Trifecta key of #1 over #2,#3,#4,#5 over #2,#3,#4,#5. This would be a $12 ticket. four-horse $1 trifecta box would cost $24. Often a better way to play a trifecta is called a Trifecta key. In this wager you use one or more “key” horses.

how long does it take for pine pollen to work	Some plants don't have flowers. Plants such as mosses and ferns reproduce by spores. Cone-bearing plants, like pine or spruce trees for example, reproduce by means of pollen that is produced by a male cone and travels by wind to a female cone of the same species. The seeds then develop in the female cone. Find out more about pollinators! Sing a Pollination Song! When pollen from a plant's stamen is transferred to that same plant's stigma, it is called self-pollination. When pollen from a plant's stamen is transferred to a different plant's stigma, it is called cross-pollination. Cross-pollination produces stronger plants. The plants must bThe effects that many people want are the increase of testosterone and androgen levels, which can take some time. Some consumers have posted their blood work publically to show the fitness community how well pine pollen does at boosting testosterone. Pine pollen works and it has increased the testosterone levels of men ages 35 and over within 1 month, however after 2 months the effects are much stronger. Many users have logged pine pollen’s results, claiming to have broken a few PR’s in the weight room. Too many. However, pine pollen actually does a good job at making someone feel better about themselves, this is the DHEA that is contained in pine pollen. Save your money on DHEA supplements and purchase pine pollen, it is the more logical approach.
is shingles rash contagious	A person can not get shingles from a person that has it. However, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles can be spread from a person with active shingles to a person who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated through direct contact with the rash. The person exposed would develop chickenpox, not shingles. The virus is not spread through sneezing, coughing or casual contact. A person with shingles can spread the disease when the rash is in the blister-phase. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.Individuals who never have had chickenpox and have not received the vaccine for chickenpox are susceptible to shingles virus infection. Consequently, shingles disease is contagious by transmission of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to these individuals. However, the shingles rash is not contagious in that a rash from one individual is unable to spread to another individual. Nevertheless, the disease of shingles can pass the virus from the active rash blisters directly to another individual who can become infected with the varicella-zoster virus. Shingles is, in this manner, contagious. Moreover, because varicella-zoster virus infection is commonly contagious in the form of chickenpox, and this infection can eventually lead to shingles development in some patients, it is fair to say that shingles is indirectly contagious by the spread of chickenpox.
what is migraine	Not all headaches represent migraines, and migraine is not the only condition that can cause severe and debilitating headaches. For example, cluster headaches are very severe headaches that affect one side of the head in a recurrent manner (occurring in a cluster over time). The pain is sometimes described as drilling, and can be worse than migraine pain in some cases. Cluster headaches are less common than migraine. Tension headaches are a more common cause of headache. Thee occur due to contraction of the muscles of the scalp, face, and neck. Although many people use the term migraine to describe any severe headache, a migraine headache is the result of specific physiologic changes that occur within the brain and lead to the characteristic pain and associated symptoms of a migraine.Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by recurrent moderate to severe headaches often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms. The word is derived from the Greek ἡμικρανία (hemikrania), pain on one side of the head, from ἡμι- (hemi-), half, and κρανίον (kranion), skull. In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's life, the probability that this is a migraine is 92%. In those with fewer than three of these symptoms the probability is 17%.
how to get home after colonoscopy	You might have some gas because of the air that was pumped into the bowel, which can cause cramping and discomfort. Because of the medicines given for the test, you will need someone to take you home. Because colonoscopy is usually done with drugs that make you sleepy, most people miss work the day of the test. After a sigmoidoscopy, you get up and walk out. If you have concerns, talk with the doctor about where and how the procedure will be done. Sigmoidoscopy typically is done in a private room, with no other patients nearby. Doctors and nurses are professional and very careful to respect the patient’s privacy.You will receive two enemas before the procedure because the rectum and lower intestine must be empty so that the intestinal walls can be seen. You will need to try to hold the enema solution for at least five minutes before releasing it. Make sure you arrange for a driver to bring you home after the colonoscopy. Because you receive sedating medication during the procedure, it is unsafe for you to drive or operate machinery for eight hours after the procedure. During a colonoscopy, the doctor uses a colonoscope, a long, flexible, tubular instrument about 1/2 inch in diameter that transmits an image of the lining of the colon so the doctor can examine it for any abnormalities. The colonoscope is inserted through the rectum and advanced to the other end of the large intestine.
ddns what is	Dynamic DNS (DDNS or DynDNS) is a method of automatically updating a name server in the Domain Name System (DNS), often in Not Real Time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information. The term is used to describe two different concepts. The first is dynamic DNS updating which refers to systems that are used to update traditional DNS records without manual editing. These mechanisms are explained in RFC 2136, and use the TSIG mechanism to provide security.Atsushi Yamada/Photodisc/Getty Images. DDNS (Dynamic DNS) is a service that maps Internet domain names to IP addresses. DDNS serves a similar purpose to the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) : DDNS allows anyone hosting a Web or FTP server to advertise a public name to prospective users. Unlike DNS that only works with static IP addresses, DDNS is designed to also support dynamic IP addresses, such as those assigned by a DHCP server. That makes DDNS a good fit for home networks, which normally receive dynamic public IP addresses from their Internet provider that occasionally change. To use DDNS, one simply signs up with a Dynamic DNS provider and installs network software on their host to monitor its IP address. Several online providers offer free DDNS subscription services that support Windows, Mac or Linux computers including FreeDNS Afraid (freedns.afraid.org) and NoIP (noip.com)
what is acsi lean	Milwaukee, Wis., March 17, 2009 — Hospitals across the United States are beginning to embrace lean and Six Sigma business management strategies in attempts to reduce costs and improve productivity, according to a new national benchmarking study by ASQ. The locations most likely to have lean and/or Six Sigma in place are: Clinical deployment. 1  Lean: Surgery/operating room (61 percent of hospitals) and emergency (60 percent). 2  Six Sigma: Emergency (72 percent) and surgery/operating room (66 percent).This month, the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) released their annual customer satisfaction scores for the airline industry and the airline carriers. To no surprise, the scores were dismal, except for one that stands out. Jetblue Airways. But in total, airline customer satisfaction is not a pretty picture. The data shows the clear difference between service and manufacturing. Now, while it’s great for JetBlue, there are clearly several problems with the ACSI methodology: 1  The Customer Satisfaction scores are released yearly. 2  Satisfaction, as a measure, is very, very broad. Nevertheless, here are the results of the ACSI Customer Satisfaction scores for the Airline Industry, broken down by airline carrier, in a nice little infographic I created for you. Enjoy. While the ACSI is not perfect, it does give us some insight into how the consumer perceives the airline carrier.
how long does it take to empty your digestive system	Digestion time varies between individuals and between men and women. After you eat, it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Food then enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion, absorption of water and, finally, elimination of undigested food. In the 1980s, Mayo Clinic researchers measured digestion time in 21 healthy people. Total transit time, from eating to elimination in stool, averaged 53 hours (although that figure is a little overstated, because the markers used by the researchers passed more slowly through the stomach than actual food).In the stomach, food tends to hang around for a little longer and this depends on a variety of factors including the amount of food you have consumed, how much fat it contains, and also the acidity of the stomach. However, all food should have left the stomach within 2 to 4 hours. In the small intestine, digestion continues and absorption occurs. From here on, the time to defecation will vary depending on the time it takes to adequately digest and absorb in the small intestine. This will usually take 5 to 6 hours. The food then enters the colon for further digestion and water reabsorption before defecation. The time from it’s entering the colon to defecation is about 12 to 24 hours. Thus, the time for food to travel from one end to the other probably ranges from about 20 to 30

what does rRNA do	RNA polymerase is the protein that makes the copy of DNA. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is part of the ribosome, or protein builders of the cell. Ribosomes are responsible for translation or the process our cells use to make proteins. rRNA are responsible for reading the order of amino acids and linking amino acids together. They do this through a highly complex sequence. To begin, ribonucleic acids (RNA) are a group of large molecules that have many different roles. They are especially important in the coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of our genes. As the name implies, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is part of the ribosome. A ribosome is the protein builder of the cell. The rest of a ribosome is made up of proteins. In addition, there are two rRNA in each ribosome, one in the large subunit and one in the small subunitAnother part of the tRNA molecule picks up an amino acid to bring to the ribosome to be added on to the growing protein. rRNA is part of the structure of a ribosome. Here's a whole explanation of the protein synthesis process. Students always find this hard to understand, but just look at it a piece at a time. It has codons, which match up with the anticodons on tRNA. tRNA is the RNA that bonds to amino acids and transfers them to ribosomes, and mRNA. The reason RNA is used is because the cytoplasm is too damaging to DNA, so RNA is kind of a scapegoat. Hopefully, this helps.
what type of epithelial tissue are in blood vessels	Epithelium (epi- + thele + -ium) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue. The other three types are connective tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. Epithelial tissues line the cavities and surfaces of blood vessels and organs throughout the body. There are three principal shapes of epithelial cells: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal. These can be arranged in a single layer of cells as simple epithelium, either squamous, columnar or cuboidal, or in layers of two or more cells deep as stratified (layered), either squamous, columnar or cuboidal. All epithelia is usually separated from underlying tissues by an extra cellular fibrous basement membrane. The lining of the mouth, lung alveoli and kidney tubules all are made of epithelial tissue. The lining of the blood and lymphatic vessels are of a specialised form of epithelium called endothelium.As a result of this basic topology, other tissues are either supported upon connective tissue (epithelial surfaces), invaginated into connective tissue (glandular epithelium), or embedded within the connective tissue (blood vessels, muscles, and nerves). Connective tissue comprises one of the four basic tissue types. The others are: epithelial tissue (surfaces and glands), muscle tissue (contractile cells), and nervous tissue. Organs represent various combinations of these four basic tissue types, which thus comprise the entire body.
what was the first gum made out of	1 Ancient Greeks chewed the gum from the mastic tree. 2  Ancient Mayans (in South America) chewed chicle which was made from the sap of the sapodilla tree. 3  North American Indians chewed sap from spruce trees. 4  Chewing gum was made and sold in America from 1848 but it was very different to the gum we know today. 1 Chewing gum was made and sold in America from 1848 but it was very different to the gum we know today. 2  It was made from spruce gum. 3  Mr Thomas Adams first introduced chewing gum made out of chicle in 1871.Chewing gum has been used in varies forms and flavors. The ancient Greeks chewed Mastiche; the ancient Mayans chewed the coagulated sap of the Sapodilla tree; North American Indians chewed the sap from spruce trees…. The first commercial chewing gum was made and sold in 1848. by John Bacon Curtis. He called his chewing gum the State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum. John B. Curtis and his brother (to some sources John B. Curtis and his father John Curtis) came up with the practical idea of how to make and sell spruce gum as a chewing gum. In 1869 he simply added flavor to the chicle! That was the first step for creating world's first modern chewing gum! The first mass marketed chewing gum was called Adams New York Chewing Gum. In the 1870s, Adams & Sons sold Sour Orange flavored gum as an after dinner candy. In 1871 Thomas Adams patented a machine for the manufacture of
age limit for child to stay home alone	Below are general guidelines to follow when considering the age range for leaving a child home alone. 7 & under-Should not be left alone for any period of time. This may include leaving children unattended in cars, playgrounds, and backyards. 8 to 10 years-Should not be left alone for more than 1½ hours and only during daylight and early evening hours. 11 to 12 years-May be left alone for up to 3 hours but not late at night or in circumstances requiring inappropriate responsibility. 13 to 15 years-May be left unsupervised, but not overnight. 16 to 17 years-May be left unsupervised (in some cases, for up to two consecutive overnight periods)Laws for Leaving a Child Home Alone. Only a couple of states have laws that specify the age when a child can be left home alone, including Maryland (age 8) and Illinois (age 14). However, most states have guidelines with the Department of Health and Human Services or other child protective agencies that test a child's ability to be left home alone. 8 to 10 years-Should not be left alone for more than 1½ hours and only during daylight and early evening hours. 11 to 12 years-May be left alone for up to 3 hours but not late at night or in circumstances requiring inappropriate responsibility. 13 to 15 years-May be left unsupervised, but not overnight. 16 to 17 years-May be left unsupervised (in some cases, for up to two consecutive overnight periods)
what medication to take for muscle spasms in back	Typically, muscle relaxants are prescribed early in a course of back pain, on a short-term basis, to relieve low back pain associated with muscle spasms. There are several types of muscle relaxant medications that are commonly used to treat low back pain. 1  See: Pulled Back Muscle and Lower Back Strain. Back Spasm Causes Video. 1  Carisoprodol (Soma) . 2  This drug's dosage is 350mg every eight hours as needed for muscle spasm. 3  Soma is typically prescribed on a short-term basis and may be habit-forming, especially if used in conjunction with alcohol or other drugs that have a sedative effect.If you have an injury or a muscle that is causing constant or repeating spasms, you should see your physician. Your doctor can prescribe medicine that will help relax your muscles and increase blood flow. Talk to your doctor if any medicine you take causes muscle spasms. 1  Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) is a commonly prescribed medication for moderate to severe muscle spasms that works on your central nervous system to relax your muscles. 2  Some muscle relaxers are highly addictive. Treat spasms with over the counter pain relievers. Sometimes muscle spasms can cause extreme pain. Ask your doctor about taking over the counter pain medicine, such as nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDS). These include ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). You may also try acetaminophen (Tylenol).
how much does it cost to get a dog spayed	1 The cost of spaying, a more complicated surgery, usually ranges from about $50 to $175. 2  Some clinics and animal hospitals can charge up to $200-$300 or more, depending on the weight of the dog. 3  The cost of both neutering and spaying vary greatly by geographic region, and even by veterinarian. 1 Extra pain medication, usually an injection before surgery and a pill for later, usually costs between $10 and $30. 2  For male dogs, testicular implants are available. 3  They cost between $94 and $919 per pair, depending on the size and model. 4  Neuticles.com offers a detailed description of the product.Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: There's a place outside my town which is a rescue that does it for $60 males and $70 females. They fixed their rescues and anyone who wants to bring their dog there just to get fixed. I would do some research through google for around your area. Type in Cheap spay/neuture and something may pop up for you. Vets are expensive but if you can't find a cheap place that does it to help prevent dogs or cats from mating then you're looking at about $200- $400 depending on your location. Also it she is in heat it is another $20. If you want her to have a pain shot, which you should, its another $15. They do have low cost spay.neuter clinics just have to look for them. So about $100 is a good guess. Source(s): dog owner for 40+yrs. ywroseoftx · 4 years ago.

what is stack-up analysis	A statistical tolerance analysis is when you take the variation of a set of inputs to calculate the expected variation of an output of interest. In mechanical engineering, a product design is composed of multiple features, each with tolerance values that control the variable aspects of those features. The simplest form of tolerance analysis is the single direction, 1D Tolerance Stackup. A 1D Tolerance Stackup is created by creating a cross section of a model and adding the tolerance values for each feature in a straight line.Instead of summing tolerances, as in worst-case analysis, statistical analysis sums dimension distributions. It is important to understand that the inputs values for a worst-case analysis are design tolerances, but the inputs for a statistical analysis are process distribution moments (e.g., standard deviation). Worst-case analysis (also called tolerance stack-up analysis) can be used to validate a design. Statistical analysis (also called variation analysis) can be used to predict the actual variation of an assembly based on the variation of the part dimensions. If the analysis involves part dimensions that are not parallel to the assembly measurement being studied, the stack-up approach must be modified since 2D variation such as angles, or any variation that is not parallel with the 1D direction, does not affect the assembly measurement with a 1-to-1 ratio.
what temp do you dehydrate apples in the oven	1 Turn the oven off and keep the apples inside as the oven cools down for 1 hour. 2  This will help them get crunchy. 3  Some apples may just be chewy and only slightly crunchy after 3 hours in the oven. 4  Store apple chips at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 week. After 2-3 hours, and flipping the apples once in between, I turn the oven off. Then I keep the apples inside the oven for 1 more hour. Sitting in the oven as it cools down, rather than sitting at room temperature, will help your apple chips crunch up much quicker. The crunchier, the better in my opinion!Drying Apples in an Oven. You can also dry apples in your oven if your oven can get the temperature down to 145 degrees Fahrenheit. (Some ovens will only go as low as 200 degrees.) You’ll need to keep the oven door open slightly to allow the moist air to escape. Positioning a fan by the door to keep air circulating is helpful too. The drying time will vary depending on which method you use, the moisture content of the apples, and how thick the apple slices are. Drying apples in a food dehydrator takes between 12 and 24 hours. Drying apples in the oven takes between 10 and 20 hours. The higher the heat, the quicker they will dry; but you’ll need to watch them closely and turn the slices often if your heat is higher than 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Drying apples over a wood stove takes about 8 to 14 hours
what are monounsaturated fats	This structure keeps monounsaturated fats liquid at room temperature. Good sources of monounsaturated fats are olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, and most nuts, as well as high-oleic safflower and sunflower oils.The discovery that monounsaturated fat could be healthful came from the Seven Countries Study during the 1960s.onounsaturated fats. When you dip your bread in olive oil at an Italian restaurant, you're getting mostly monounsaturated fat. Monounsaturated fats have a single carbon-to-carbon double bond. The result is that it has two fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fat and a bend at the double bond.Monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) are good fats. Liquid at room temperature, they turn solid when they are chilled. Common sources of MUFAs are olive oil, avocadoes and nuts. Monounsaturated fats are a healthy alternative to the trans fats and refined polyunsaturated fats you find in most processed foods.Research shows that diets with healthy amounts of monounsaturated fats have a host of amazing health benefits, including: 1. 1  Decreased risk for breast cancer.ommon sources of MUFAs are olive oil, avocadoes and nuts.

why does glucose produce more carbon dioxide than starch in fermentation	The hypothesis was supported in that all forms of sugar produced energy and that glucose was the most efficient. The carbon dioxide produced can be directly related to the energy produced through fermentation because carbon dioxide is a by-product of ethanol fermentation (Cellular, 54). The control that contained no sugar produced no energy because a source of sugar is required for glycolysis and fermentation to occur. Sucrose yielded 9.27 mm of carbon dioxide per minute during fermentation while fructose functioned at a rate of 3.99 mm of carbon dioxide per minute. The control that contained no sugar had no rate of carbon dioxide production.But glucose is easier to break down than sucrose and starch. Glucose is monosaccharide. They are the simplest carbohydrates. Through glycolysis and later in the reactions of the Citric acid cycle (TCAC), glucose is oxidized to eventually form CO2 and water, yielding energy, mostly in the form of ATP. Sucrose is a disaccharide, consists of 2 monosaccharides. While starch is a polysaccharide, a complex carbohydrate. Not all yeast produce and secrete amylase, and it would take time to do this. Hence why little to no CO2 Sucrose (a glucose-fructose di-sacharide) is fairly small, but it too needs to be broken down into individual glucose and fructose molecules. To do this the yeast must produce the enzyme (sucrase, invertase, or alpha-glucosidase)
what kind of oil is good for dry hair	If you’ve never experimented with olive oil as a hair product before, use just a tablespoon or two for your first treatment. 2. Massage. Massage the oil deeply into your hair for a few minutes. You can also massage it on to your scalp if you have dry scalp. For the most effective conditioning, wrap your hair in a shower cap and let the oil soak in for 15 minutes or more. 3. Rinse. Shampoo rigorously and dry your hair to see results. You might need to shampoo twice, depending on how much you’ve applied. There’s nothing harmful about conditioning with olive oil. Unless your hair is dry enough to require a moisturizing treatment every day, use it once a week or less often for the best results.Lavender oil deep conditions the hair, keeps it shiny, and helps control dandruff. Moroccan argan oil moisturizes, nourishes, and provides antioxidants to hair. Rosemary oil stimulates the roots, improves hair growth, and increases circulation in the scalp. Sandalwood oil helps with dry ends, and adds fragrance to the hair. How to Use Essential Oils. You only need a few drops of an essential oil -- mix one or more types in a shampoo or conditioner.

what is a fridge used for	Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. Most households use the freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style, which has been the basic style since the 1940s. A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator–freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior. 1 Air from the freezer section is diverted to the refrigerator door, to cool milk or juice stored in the door shelf. 2  A drop down door built into the refrigerator main door, giving easy access to frequently used items such as milk, thus saving energy by not having to open the main door.Wipe the inside of the refrigerator with your preferred cleaning solution. Attack any big or stubborn stains and hit all the remaining surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge. 1  You probably don't want to use soap or a chemical cleaner on the inside of the fridge, as food will absorb the smell. Wipe down all exterior surfaces of the refrigerator, including the front, back, sides, and top. 1  Pull the refrigerator forward to expose all sides. 2  Clean the all exterior surfaces using a towel and all-purpose cleaner. 3  If your model has the coils mounted on the back of the unit, skip wiping the back until Part 3.
what does it mean for computers people	Whether it’s storing files in the cloud, listening to music in the cloud or saving pictures to the cloud, more and more people are using 'the cloud.' For those who haven’t quite caught on, 'the cloud' still means those white puffy things in the sky. In technology, however, it’s something completely different. Here’s a breakdown of what the cloud is and how regular, everyday people are using it. What Do People Mean by The Cloud? The term 'cloud' is simply how a network or remote servers can be accessed via an internet connection store and manage information. In other words, it’s a place other than you computer that you can use to store your stuff. Before we had cloud storage services, we had to save all of our files to our computers, on our local hard drives. These days, we have multiple desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets and smartphones that we may need to access our files from.A computer is a machine that is able to take information, and process it to make new information. Calculating machines have existed for much of human history. A computer is a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer are: It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions. Early examples are the astrolabe and the abacus. There are four main processing steps in a computer, and they are: inputting
what is healing dance	Based in the belief that the body, the mind and the spirit are interconnected, dance/movement therapy is defined by the American Dance Therapy Association as the psychotherapeutic use of movement as a process that furthers the emotional, cognitive, social and physical integration of the individual.. A Brief History of Dance/movement Therapy. The roots of dance/movement therapy can be traced to the early 20th century and the work of DMT pioneer, Marian Chace. Chace was a modern dancer in Washington, D.C. who began teaching dance after ending her career with the Denishawn Dance Company in 1930.Healing Dance therapy combines beautiful movements characterized by spaciousness, flow, freedom, lightness, and three dimensionality. The Healing Dance therapy is based on wave movements for the entire body, embraces, releases, traction, smooth transitions, joint mobilization and massage, all woven together in the flow. A graceful and powerful form of aquatic bodywork, conducted in warm water, integrating elements of Watsu ®, WaterDance ®, Trager Work, movement and dance. Healing Dance therapy reflects how water and the body naturally move together. The essence of Healing Dance therapy is flow, freedom and lightness. Healing Dance therapy is based on the philosophy that movements and touch are therapeutic, so the remedial process in the body is activated by experience of the “received dance”
cost of liposonix vic	However, it is important to keep in mind several points. First, LipoSonix will likely require multiple treatments which will add to the cost of a single procedure. That’s why a “total” average cost for undergoing LipoSonix is closer to $2,500, which would relate to an average of 2.5 individual treatments per patient. Additionally, this will be an out of pocket expense, and will not be covered by insurance. It also means that you won’t have to deal with the other side effects, including pain and bruising, lengthy recovery times, and so forth. One of the major cons is that LipoSonix really isn’t a solution for individuals who still need to undergo a lot of weight loss.However, you should not resume to extensive exercise for at least two weeks. The cost per treatment is significantly less than more invasive treatments. Cost will depend on the method and extent of surgery but may range from $2000. The price will vary depending on the extent of treatment but in most cases, Liposuction Melbourne prices may range from $3,000. A possibility of a Medicare rebate may be deducted from the cost depending on your situation. The ideal candidate should be at a balanced weight and within about 20% to 30% of your ideal weight. Discuss your goals with the surgeon so that you both can reach an understanding about what can be achieved. Your skin is also a factor in whether you are a good candidate.

what does the eukaryotic cell do	In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells may contain several other types of organelles, which may include mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Each of these organelles performs a specific function critical to the cell's survival. Moreover, nearly all eukaryotic organelles are separated from the rest of the cellular space by a membrane, in much the same way that interior walls separate the rooms in a house. Eukaryotic cells — those that make up cattails and apple trees, mushrooms and dust mites, halibut and readers of Scitable — have evolved ways to partition off different functions to various locations in the cell. In fact, specialized compartments called organelles exist within eukaryotic cells for this purpose.Eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those of prokaryotes. They have a variety of internal membrane-bound structures, called organelles, and a cytoskeleton composed of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments, which play an important role in defining the cell's organization and shape. An animal cell is a form of eukaryotic cell that makes up many tissues in animals. Animal cells are distinct from other eukaryotes, most notably plant cells, as they lack cell walls and chloroplasts. They also have smaller vacuoles. Due to the lack of a cell wall, animal cells can adopt a variety of shapes.
how long to cook a prime rib in oven	4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°)1 Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 2  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 3  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 4  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5
what is an offtake agreement	DEFINITION of 'Offtake Agreement'. An agreement between a producer of a resource and a buyer of a resource to purchase/sell portions of the producer's future production. An offtake agreement is normally negotiated prior to the construction of a facility such as a mine in order to secure a market for the future output of the facility. If lenders can see the company will have a purchaser of its production, it makes it easier to obtain financing to construct a facility. Next Up. BREAKING DOWN 'Offtake Agreement'. Offtake agreements are frequently used in natural resource development, where the capital costs to extract the resource is signficant and the company wants a guarantee that some of its product will be sold.Default Clauses in Offtake Agreements. The third most important clause of an offtake agreement is the ability of one party to cancel the contract through a default by the other party. Because offtake agreements are legal contracts, cancellation of the contract is usually not permitted. Default agreements will state what constitutes a default, such as the violation of one clause or multiple clauses that will result in penalties. Benefits of Offtake Agreements. Offtake agreements have benefits for both the sellers and buyers of resources and services. They give sellers the guarantee that they can sell their resources in the future and can earn a profit on their investment.
what does inclusion mean in the classroom	1 In an inclusion classroom, a general education teacher and a special education teacher work together to meet the needs of students. 2  This type of classroom gives special education students the support they need while they learn alongside their general education peers. 1 Studies show that general education students benefit from the resources available in an inclusion classroom. 2  The special education teacher can help all children in an inclusion classroom, not just special education students.Inclusion in education describes an approach wherein students with special educational needs spend most or all of their time with non-disabled students. Inclusion was once thought only necessary for educating students with special educational needs until dual certification of special educators as school teacher leaders. Now it is crucial that all of teachers ensure inclusive practice for all students in their classroom and the wider school. Implementation of inclusion practice varies and schools most frequently use the strategy for select students with mild to severe special needs. Some advocates of inclusion promote the adoption of progressive education practices. In the progressive education or inclusive classroom, everyone is exposed to a rich set of activities, and each student does what he or she can do, or what he or she wishes to do and learns whatever comes from that experience.

types of sedimentary rocks	Sedimentary Rocks. Picture Gallery of the Most Common Rock Types. Breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of large (over two millimeter diameter) angular fragments. The spaces between the large fragments can be filled with a matrix of smaller particles or a mineral cement which binds the rock together. Chemical sedimentary rocks, such as rock salt, iron ore, chert, flint, some dolomites, and some limestones, form when dissolved materials precipitate from solution. Organic sedimentary rocks such as coal, some dolomites, and some limestones, form from the accumulation of plant or animal debris. Photos and brief descriptions of some common sedimentary rock types are shown on this page. Coal is an organic sedimentary rock that forms mainly from plant debrisSandstone is a common clastic sedimentary rock formed by the compaction and cementation of sand (quartz grains). Conglomerate is another clastic sedimentary rock formed by the cementation of rounded boulders, cobbles, and pebbles. On the other hand, breccia forms from angular boulders, cobbles, and pebbles. Coal is considered a sedimentary rock. Some might classify it as a biologic sedimentary rock as it forms from the compaction and alteration of accumulated plant matter. Coal is classified into one of three types depending on its level of development. Lignite is a soft, brown coal and is the least developed form.
why is wearing a seatbelt important	The reason why wearing a seatbelt is important is because seatbelts are designed to protect, it is the law and statistics prove that wearing a seatbelt is safer than not wearing one at all, and wearing a seatbelt will save a person money on medical bills and related costs due to an accident. A seatbelt will also protect a person from whiplash. Injuries due to a person not wearing a seatbelt include abdominal injuries (if worn too high), skin abrasions and injuries to the carotid artery, throat and cervical spine. Injuries to the chest, shoulders and ribs are at high risk if not properly wearing a seatbelt. Seatbelts are important when it comes to the lawWearing a seat belt every time you enter a vehicle is not only the smart thing to do it is the right thing because it saves lives, it's the law and it will save you money. Car accidents are the leading cause of death for people under the age of 35. Wearing a seat belt can prevent death in about half of these accidents. Did you know that every 15 seconds someone is injured in an automobile accident if they are not buckled up, or that every 13 minutes someone is killed in a crash. The Importance of Wearing a Seatbelt. We have all heard the excuses before, It's uncomfortable, I'm only going around the corner, I'd rather be thrown out of a car than be stuck in a seatbelt, and my favorite, I'm a good driver I don't need to wear one..

I was curious as to how much others had to pay for their pinsThe cost of long term care varies greatly, depending on the type of care, the place provided, and the region where you receive your care. For instance, the average hourly cost of home care ranges from $15 per hour in Montgomery, Alabama, to $24 per hour in Hartford, Connecticut. Nursing home care costs vary from $148 per day in Shreveport, Louisiana, to $462 in New York City for a semiprivate room. Home care — which most people prefer — is generally more affordable than nursing home care, but still can be expensive. When averaged nationally, the cost of a six-hour visit by a home health aide is $114. That's $29,640 per year for a home health aide visiting six hours per day, five days a week. These costs rise significantly if around-the-clock care is needed.

what does the lungs do	The alveoli in the lungs are coated with a moist film that dissolves air in the lungs. Oxygen diffuses across the thin epithelium of the alveoli sacs into the blood within the surrounding capillaries. Carbon dioxide also diffuses from the blood in the capillaries to the alveoli air sacs. The now oxygen rich blood is returned to the heart via the pulmonary veins. Carbon dioxide is expelled from the lungs by exhalation. The lungs are organs of the respiratory system that allow us to take in and expel air. In the breathing process, the lungs take in oxygen from the air through inhalation. Carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration is in turn released throughThe lungs provide a surface for gas exchange in mammals. Inside the lungs are the alveoli, in which oxygen dissolves into the blood. Is is basically a gas exchange. The lungs filter the heart with fresh oxygen and get it in the blood and pumped into the rest of the body until you breath out, which makes carbon dioxide! This is called the pulmonary circulation. From your pulmonic valve, blood travels to the pulmonary artery to tiny capillary vessels in the lungs. Here, oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs, through the walls of the capillaries, into the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, passes from the blood into the air sacs. Carbon dioxide leaves the body when you exhale.
how long does it take to get a canadian tax refund back if submitted by post office mail	Processing Times for Tax Refunds. The length of time it takes the CRA to process your income tax return and refund depends on how and when you file your return. Processing Times for Paper Returns. Paper returns usually take four to six weeks to process. For paper tax returns filed before April 15, wait four weeks before you check on your refund. For paper tax returns filed after April 15, wait six weeks before you check. Processing Times for Electronic Returns. Electronic (NETFILE or EFILE) returns can take as little as eight business days to be processed. Check on Your Tax Refund Online. You can check on the status of your income tax refund using the My Account tax service. In 2015 the Quick Access Service is no longer available from the CRA.The IRS eliminated the refund schedules that were used in prior years for both direct deposit and mailed refunds. The guideline the IRS is using in 2015 for filing your 2014 tax return is: Don’t count on getting your refund by a certain date to make major purchases or pay other financial obligations. Even though the IRS issues most refunds in less than 21 days, it’s possible your tax return may require additional review and take longer. My husband and I filed on Feb 2, 2012 with H&R Block. And were supposed to get our electronic refund within two weeks between the 15th and 21st. Now the IRS is sending our refund on March 7th a month later.
prostate cancer what to look for	Prostate cancer symptoms. Very early prostate cancer does not usually cause any symptoms at all. Any growth in the prostate is too small at first for you to notice any effect on urine flow. Mnay men go to see their GP because they have problems with passing urine.The most common symptoms of prostate cancer and a non cancerous (benign) enlarged prostate are the same.They are. 1  Having to rush to the toilet to pass urine. 2  Passing urine more often than usual, especially at night. 3  Difficulty passing urine, including straining to pass it or stopping and starting.ymptoms may be mild and can occur over many years. Sometimes the first symptoms are from prostate cancer that has spread to the bones but this is not common. Prostate cancer cells in the bone may cause pain in your back, hips, pelvis or other bony areas.Types of Prostate Cancer. Abnormal growth in the prostate is not necessarily prostate cancer. It can, for instance, be a benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). As for growths that actually are prostate cancer, there are two types: aggressive (fast-growing) or nonaggressive (slow-growing).rostate cancer usually occurs in men over the age of 65. Other risk factors for developing prostate cancer include: 1  age. 2  a family history of prostate cancer. 3  ethnicity or race (for instance, African American males are at a greater risk for developing prostate cancer). 4  obesity.
how many feet in a nautical mile	A statute mile is 5,280 feet in length. A nautical mile is 6,076.11549... feet in length. To convert from statute to nautical miles a factor of 1.15 is generally used, even though it is not precise. (5,280 feet X 1.15) = 6,072 feet (4.11549...feet less than 1 nautical mile).You could add 4.1 feet for each statute mile to be converted. So the new formula would be: {(5280 feet x 1.15)+ 4.1 feet} divided by 6,076.1 feet = 1 nautical mile. To convert from nautical to statute miles: The factor 1.15 may be used, but again, it is not precise. (6076.1 divided by 1.15) = 5,283 feet (3.565..feet more than 1 statute mile).The length was based on converting [1 nautical mile per hour] to [feet per second(fps)], and then multiplying [fps] by 30 seconds (which was a practical time to spend counting knots with a sandglass). The result was the calibrated length in feet at which to tie the knots for a 30-second run of the chip log. The faster the ship was sailing, more knots and a longer length of rope were played out. The number of knots in the rope that were counted in 30 seconds, then, was equal to the speed of the ship in nautical miles per hour. A knot, therefore, is not a nautical mile, it is a nautical mile per hour. Thus 1 knot was equivalent to 1 nautical mile per hour; 5 knots were equivalent to 5 nautical miles per hour; etc. The similar sound of knot and naut is entirely coincidental
where abouts is your liver	Front View of the Liver. The liver is a large, meaty organ that sits on the right side of the belly. Weighing about 3 pounds, the liver is reddish-brown in color and feels rubbery to the touch. Normally you can't feel the liver, because it's protected by the rib cage. The liver has two large sections, called the right and the left lobes. 1 Hepatitis: Inflammation of the liver, usually caused by viruses like hepatitis A, B, and C. Hepatitis can have non-infectious causes too, including heavy drinking, drugs, allergic reactions, or obesity. 2  Cirrhosis: Long-term damage to the liver from any cause can lead to permanent scarring, called cirrhosis.The liver is located on the upper side of your right abdomen below your diaphragm and enclosed by your rib cage. At the back of your liver is where the gallbladder is located and closer to the spleen, stomach, intestines and kidneys. You can actually feel your liver by laying your fingers under your right rib cage. The liver processes everything you ingest into your body, from foods to medicines, even lotions and deodorants. Know where your liver is located. Now that you already have an idea as to the exact location of the liver, check the location of your liver. lie down onto the floor and push the right side of your abdomen below your rib cage and inhale. A healthy liver must be situated along the diaphragm all through your lowest rib.
blood disorders that cause pain	Blood Disorders Affecting Red Blood Cells. Blood disorders that affect red blood cells include: Anemia: People with anemia have a low number of red blood cells. Mild anemia often causes no symptoms.More severe anemia can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath with exertion.Iron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells.Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.ron-deficiency anemia: Iron is necessary for the body to make red blood cells. Low iron intake and loss of blood due to menstruation are the most common causes of iron-deficiency anemia. It may also be caused by blood loss from the GI tract because of ulcers or cancer.Common causes of secondary dysmenorrhea include: 1  Endometriosis. 2  Endometriosis is a chronic and often progressive disease that develops when the tissue that lines the uterus (endometrium) grows onto other areas, such as the ovaries, bowels, or bladder. 3  It often causes chronic pelvic pain.lood tests can help rule out other conditions that cause menstrual disorders. For example, your doctor may test thyroid function to make sure that low thyroid (hypothyroidism) is not present. Blood tests can also check follicle-stimulating hormone, estrogen, and prolactin levels.
how many steps per minute is considered a brisk pace for fitness walking	A 10 minute walk at about 120 paces per minute is 1 200 paces. You might even like to break that up into 2 five minute walks of 600 paces each. Your overall goal in Stage 1 is to develop the habit of 'going for a walk' every day. This will give you your speed in metres per minute. If you walk at 120 paces per minute and your pace is 750 mm (0.75 metres), you will be walking at 90 metres per minute (120 x 0.75 = 90 m/min), and if you walk for an hour 90 metres multiplied by 60 minutes equals 5.4 km (90 x 60 = 5400 metres = 5.4 km).If you are walking casually with a friend, maybe shopping in a mall, you're probably also taking 100 steps a minute. If you are walking as exercise, here's how to calculate the number of steps you take, according to walking expert Mark Fenton, author of Complete Guide to Walking for Health, Fitness, and Weight Loss. Walking purposefully (@ 3mph)= 120 steps per minute. Power walking; if you went any faster you'd be running (@4.5 mph) = 150 steps per minute. To add 6,000 steps to your day can be relatively easy. By taking a few short breaks a day, you can sneak them in without much more time and effort. Walking with purpose (@ 3mph) = 120 steps per minute. Walking briskly, like you're late for a bus (@3.5-4 mph) = 135 steps per minute. Power walking; if you went any faster you'd be running (@4.5 mph) = 150 steps per minute Each mile walked = 2,000 steps.
what to remove from cell phone before discarding it	1 Go to the Wireless Recycling Cell Phone Data Eraser Page. 2  Follow the instructions to download a wiping utility for your phone. 3  You may then choose to follow the last instruction (dropping it off at their recycling center) or to trade it in to a mobile service provider. 1 If you do this, all information on your phone will be destroyed. 2  You should back it up somewhere first. 3  If you are staying with the same service provider, you should back up all your contacts to the SIM card (see your phone’s manual), then remove the card prior to wiping the phone.Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images. Whether buying a new phone and recycling that old cell phone, selling a cell phone or giving it away, you'll want to delete all of your personal data, contacts, passwords, pins, credit card information and other information before you hand the phone over to a new owner. Instructions. Back up your data prior to deleting the information by using your cell phone network's backup service, through data manager software included with your cell phone or through a third-party data manager such as BitPim. Eject your cell phone's microSD card. Remove the SIM card, if you have a GSM phone. Most manufacturers place the SIM card near the battery and require that you remove the back cover to access the card. Other cell phones, such as the iPhone, require that you eject the card with a paper clip
what way do afferent nerves carry impulses	Describes nerves that carry impulses towards the central nervous system, or to relay stations outside it, from neural receptors (e.g. sensory nerves from the skin, those conveying proprioceptive information from muscles and joints or visceral afferents from internal organs). Carrying inward to a central organ or section, as nerves that conduct impulses from the periphery of the body to the brain or spinal cord. n. An afferent organ or body part, such as a blood vessel.(April 2014). In the peripheral nervous system, an afferent nerve fiber is the nerve fiber (axon) of an afferent neuron (sensory neuron). It is a long process (projection) extending far from the nerve cell body that carries nerve impulses from sensory receptors or sense organs toward the central nervous system. The opposite direction of neural activity is efferent conduction. In the nervous system there is a closed loop system of sensation, decision, and reactions. This process is carried out through the activity of afferent neurons (sensory neurons), interneurons, and efferent neurons (motor neurons). Afferent neurons' somas are located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, and the axons of these cells travel from ganglion to ganglion and lead back to the spinal cord. The majority of these are unipolar neurons in that they have a single axon leaving the cell body and is sent towards the sensory organ.
what is the metric unit commonly used for work	Unlike the English system with which you are already familiar, the metric system is based on units of ten, thus simplifying interconversions (table B.1). This base-ten system is similar to our monetary system, in which 10 cents equals a dime, 10 dimes equals a dollar, and so on. Although the metric system is the only measurement system ever acknowledged by Congress, the United States remains out of step with the rest of the world by clinging to the antiquated English system of measurements involving pounds, inches, and so on. Metric units commonly used in biology include.The simplicity of the metric system stems from the fact that there is only one unit of measurement (or base unit) for each type of quantity measured (length, mass, etc.). The three most common base units in the metric system are the meter, gram, and liter. The meter is a unit of length equal to 3.28 feet; the gram is a unit of mass equal to approximately 0.0022 pounds (about the mass of a paper clip); and the liter is a unit of volume equal to 1.05 quarts. This is much simpler than the American system of measurement, in which we have to remember inches, feet, miles, and many more units of measurement. Metric prefixes can be used with any base unit. For example, a kilometer is 1,000 meters, a kilogram is 1,000 grams, and a kiloliter is 1,000 liters. Six common prefixes used in the metric system are listed below
what distinguishes fungi from other kingdoms	Distinguishing characters of fungi are: 1.It is a plant like microscopic multicellular organism living on a nutrient substrate. 2.They are achlorophyllous,heterotrophic thallophytes. 3.Every fungi contains mass of interwoven hyphae is called mycelium. 4.The mycelium may be unicellular or multicellular. Fungi, a member of kingdom plantae has features that distinguishes  it from the rest. They are heterotrophic, eukaryotic organisms,  have cell walls made of chitin, they do … not have distinct disuse  differentiation and propagate by means of spores. Answered. In Biology.Plant-like protists make their own food, and many have cell walls made of cellulose. Animal-like protists cannot make their own food and ingest it. Some animal-like protests have “shells,” called tests, which are made of silica or calcium carbonate. Other animal-like protists lack a cell wall or protective test. The fungi-like protists are actually not evolutionarily related to fungi, although they do take in food by absorption. Like plants, however, their cell walls are made of cellulose. Animal-like protist. The majority of organisms classified as protists are unicellular though there are a few multicellular organisms. For example, kelp (“seaweed”) is technically a protist even though it is multicellular. Kelp is not grouped with plants, however, because it lacks the cellular complexity present in plant cells.
what types of waters do brook trout live in	Brook or Speckled Trout. Brook trout are native to the state and are New York State's official state fish. Brook trout generally live in small-to moderate-sized streams, lakes, and ponds, wherever cool (below 72 degrees Fahrenheit) water is available. They tend to prefer colder water than rainbow and brown trout, and they are often found in the headwaters of streams. The DEC stocks round 151,000 brook trout each spring. Fishing for Stream Trout. With thousands of miles of streams across the state, there are ample opportunities to trout fish in New York Sate. Each year the DEC stocks around 2.3 million catchable-size brook, brown and rainbow trout in almost 300 lakes, ponds and roughly 3,100 miles of streams across the state.The brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is a species of freshwater fish in the salmon family Salmonidae. It is native to Eastern North America in the United States and Canada, but has also been artificially introduced elsewhere in North America and to other continents. In parts of its range, it is also known as the eastern brook trout, speckled trout, brook charr, squaretail, or mud trout, among others. A potamodromous population in Lake Superior is known as coaster trout or, simply, as coasters. The brook trout is the state fish of nine states: Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia
what are three general characteristics of connective tissues	Many of the fibers are strong protein fibers called collagen. Loose connective tissue is found beneath the skin and between organs. It is a binding and packing material whose main purpose is to provide support to hold other tissues and organs in place. It connects muscles to muscles, muscles to bones and bone to bones. It is characterized by the presence of a nonliving, extracellular matrix produced and secreted by the cells; it varies in amount and consistency. 1  Have a rich supply of blood vessels. 2  Composed of many types of cells. 3  Great deal of noncellular, nonliving material (matrix) between the cells of connective tissuConnective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system the outer membranes, the meninges, that cover the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. All connective tissue apart from blood and lymph consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. (Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue.) Blood and lymph lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.

normal range for iron	1 Hemoglobin. 2  Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 3  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 4  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 5  Ferritin. 1 Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 2  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 3  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 4However, in otherwise healthy individuals, the relative amount of ferritin found in serum is an accurate surrogate measure for iron stored in body organs. Serum ferritin measurements range from about 15–200 ng/ml for women and 20–300 ng/ml for men. Although laboratory ranges vary, most are close to these values. Approximately 95% of the population will fall within “normal” population range simply because ranges are calculated using standard statistical methodology. In people with undiagnosed hemochromatosis, this number is often above 50%, and sometimes even as high as 100%. The optimal range of TS % is generally between 25–35%. When the percentage is calculated to be less that about 17% or higher than 45%, a condition of either iron deficiency or iron overload is possible.
what is tubular adenoma	Adenomas have several different growth patterns that can be seen under the microscope by the pathologist. There are 2 major growth patterns: tubular and villous. Because many adenomas have a mixture of both growth patterns, some polyps may be called tubulovillous adenomas. Most adenomas that are small (less than ½ inch) have a tubular growth pattern. Larger adenomas may have a villous growth pattern. Larger adenomas more often have cancers developing in them. Adenomas with a villous growth pattern are also more likely to have cancers develop in them. A polyp is a projection (growth) of tissue from the inner lining of the colon into the lumen (hollow center) of the colon. Different types of polyps look different under the microscope. Polyps are benign (non-cancerous) growths, but cancer can start in some types of polyps.A tubular adenoma is a kind of breast adenoma characterized by densely packed ‘ tubular ‘ and ‘ acinar ‘ (bud-like) cell formations. An adenoma is a disorganized neoplasm consisting of varied amounts of glandular, fibrous, and fat tissue that can result in a mass or pseudo-lesion. Have a look at our new and improved page on tubular adenoma – it is more up-to-date. However, this one is still pretty good, too! Histologically (microscopically), the tubular and acinar cell formations, which are actually small breast ducts, tend to be very small and regular in size.

what is furfural	Furfural was first isolated in 1821 (published in 1832) by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Doebereiner, döbereiner who produced a small sample as a byproduct of formic acid. Synthesis at the, time formic acid was formed by the distillation of dead, ants And'doebereiner döbereiner s ant bodies probably contained some. plant matter Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA), which is a useful chemical intermediate and which may be further hydrogenated to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). THFA is used as a nonhazardous solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure.Furfural is an organic compound derived from a variety of agricultural byproducts, including corncobs, oat, wheat bran, and sawdust. The name furfural comes from the Latin word furfur, meaning bran, referring to its usual source. Furfural is a heterocyclic aldehyde, with the ring structure shown at right. Its chemical formula is O C 4 H 3 CHO. It is a colorless oily liquid with the odor of almonds, which quickly darkens when exposed to air. Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA), which is a useful chemical intermediate and which may be further hydrogenated to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). THFA is used as a nonhazardous solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure.
what is the average pageviews for a site	As a rule of thumb, a bounce rate in the range of 26 to 40 percent is excellent. 41 to 55 percent is roughly average. 56 to 70 percent is higher than average, but may not be cause for alarm depending on the website. Anything over 70 percent is disappointing for everything outside of blogs, news, events, etc. The chart above plots out the number of websites that fell within a particular range from the sample set. The bounce rate for the average website is more likely to dance to the tune of 40 to 55 percent. Once it tips over 50 percent, it’s probably time to identify which user segments or content are driving the bounce rate up. Even a bounce rate over 60% might not be badFor example, an advertising site having an average CPM of $25.00 and an average 3 page views per visit would make the following calculation: $25 / 1,000 page views * 3.00 page views / visit = $0.075 per visit. Expectation. Expectations about average page views per visit depend on your business model. Definition. The total number of page views divided by the total number of visits during the same timeframe. Page Views / Visits = Average Page Views per Visit. Sophisticated users may also want to calculate average page views per visit for different visitor segments. Presentation. Presentation of average page views per visit can be supplemented by associating the monetary value of a page view for the advertising

To get a mountain dragon, use cold (left) and plant (right). 1  Breeding Guide. 2  How to Get Free Gems. 3  How to Obtain the Rainbow Dragon. 4  How to Breed a Reindeer Dragon. How to get free gems. 1  Sign out of game center before entering Dragon Vale. 2  Click cancel when prompted and connect to game center to start a new game. 3  Then go back to game center, sign in, and click on your level once you go back to the game. 4  You should be supplied with a few more diamonds and coins.By DoubleDizle on. 2 Comments. If you need some fast and easy money in DragonVale, then breeding is one of the best ways to get them. Certain dragons sell for a lot more cash than others, so you can make a lot of money if you know which dragons to breed. Most of the best selling dragons require higher levels, so I’ll show you some dragons in various different level requirements, and how much you can potentially earn per hour from them. Making Easy Coins at Lower Levels. There aren’t a whole lot of options at the very beginning of the game for making a ton of coins (for obvious reasons). Your best option at level one if you just want to make coins is to breed the Plant Dragon over and over which sells for $50, with a 14.4 second breeding time.
what is erosion of phalanx	Superficial Acral Fibromyxoma of the Toe, with Erosion of the Distal Phalanx. References. Superficial acral fibromyxoma (SAFM) is a slow growing soft tissue tumor commonly located at the distal ungual region of the fingers and toes. SAFM, was first medically acknowledged in 2001. SAFM has a predilection towards males, ages 14-72. In this clinical study, a 35-year-old male living in a rural setting with a two-year history of the tumor is discussed. The tumor was located at the right toe, distal phalanx and was approximately 2 cm in diameter. It was a painless, raised lesion and showed no signs of metastasis to the proximal area of skin. The tumor had displaced the overlying nail. Superficial acral fibromyxoma (SAFM) is a slow growing soft tissue tumor commonly located at the distal ungual region of the fingers and toAlthough not so frequent as erosive abnormality of the ulnar styloid process, erosion of the radial styloid process has been noted in 11 per cent of rheumatoid wrists. At this site, there is an unprotected or bare area on the surface of the bone adjacent to the radial collateral ligament. The IP I is a typical location of resorptive erosions which may be observed at the dorsal aspect of the first metacarpal bone subjacent to the extensor pollicis longus tendon and on the proximal phalanx at the insertions of the flexor pollicis brevis and adductor pollicis muscles.
what causes genetic variation	By Regina Bailey. Definition: In genetic variation, the genes of organisms within a population change. Gene alleles determine distinct traits that can be passed on from parents to offspring. Gene variation is important to the process of natural selection. The genetic variations that arise in a population happen by chance, but the process of natural selection does not. Natural selection is the result of the interactions between genetic variations in a population and the environment. The environment determines which variations are more favorable. Genetic variation occurs mainly through DNA mutation, gene flow (movement of genes from one population to another) and sexual reproduction.Genetic variation is a fact that a biological system – individual and population – is different over space. It is the base of the genetic variability of different biological systems in space. Genetic variation is based on the variation in alleles of genes in a gene pool. It occurs both within and among populations, supported by individual carriers of the variant genes. Genetic variation is brought about by random mutation, which is a permanent change in the chemical structure of a gene. Random mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation. Mutations are likely to be rare and most mutations are neutral or deleterious, but in some instances the new alleles can be favored by natural selection.
what is an actuator	An actuator is a type of motor that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, typically electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion. An actuator is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e.g. a printer driver, robot control system), a human, or any other input. A pneumatic actuator converts energy formed by vacuum or compressed air at high pressure into either linear or rotary motion. Pneumatic energy is desirable for main engine controls because it can quickly respond in starting and stopping as the power source does not need to be stored in reserve for operation.Fisher ® spring and diaphragm pneumatic actuators can be direct-acting, meaning that air to the diaphragm casing pushes the actuator stem downward. This air-to-close action compresses the spring, which in turn pushes the actuator stem back up when the supply pressure is decreased or lost. Additionally, spring and diaphragm pneumatic actuators can be reverse-acting, meaning that air to the diaphragm casing causes the actuator stem to move upward. This air-to-open action compresses the spring, which in turn causes the actuator stem to move downward when supply pressure is decreased.

when does implantation occur after fertilization	Implantation typically occurs 6 to 10 days after ovulation, or day 20 to 24 of a menstrual cycle. However, it can happen a few days earlier or later. In an average 28-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14 with the first day of a woman's period being considered day 1 in a cycle. Once fertilization occurs, the egg stays in the fallopian tube for three days before entering the uterus and begins to implant itself to the uterine lining. Find out when implantation will happen based on your last menstrual period or ovulation date with our implantation calculator.Implantation bleeding can be seen about a day or so after implantation, which happens about 9 days after ovulation/fertilization (range: 6-12 days). Fertilization happens in the fallopian tube, and the fertilized egg then travels for about 5-6 days down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. Implantation happens when the fertilized egg arrives in the uterus and attaches to the uterine lining. Implantation occurs on average 9 days after ovulation and fertilization, it can happen as early as 6 days after ovulation until 12 days after ovulation. The timing of implantation spotting is within a day or so after implantation, about 9-10 days after ovulation and fertilization. Implantation happens between 6 and 12 days after ovulation, so about 9-10 days after ovulation would be the right time for implantation bleeding and spotting
what matter is a cloud	clouds are actually a LIQUID because when water vapor is formed, it moves up to the sky.Then while it goes up, condensation happens.condensation is a part of the water cycle.during condensation, the water vapor which is a gas turns back to liquid.so, clouds are actually very small droplets of water.since clouds actually are from water vapor, which is a gas, condensation happens so that clouds will form.condensation means t … hat from gas which is water vapor, turns back to liquid,that forms clouds.so, clouds are also known as liquid... 6 people found this useful. Clouds are formed when water droplets contained in the air rise higher into the atmosphere. There they collect, until a cloud is formed. When water evaporates into the air, it hits the dew point temperature and sticks to smoke and dust particle in the air. Next, it condenses to form a cloudWater is known to exist in three different states; as a solid, liquid or gas. Clouds, snow, and rain are all made of up of some form of water. A cloud is comprised of tiny water droplets and/or ice crystals, a snowflake is an aggregate of many ice crystals, and rain is just liquid water. Water existing as a gas is called water vapor. When referring to the amount of moisture in the air, we are actually referring to the amount of water vapor. If the air is described as moist, that means the air contains large amounts of water vapor.
is it normal to have blood before your period	Spotting and Menstrual Cycles. Occasional spotting that occurs before a period or in the middle of a cycle is not a reason to be worried, as it is usually normal. However, make sure that the bleeding is from your vagina and not from your urine or rectum. You could find out by using a tampon. Other Causes of Spotting Before Your Period. Mild vaginal bleeding before your period may also be related to other conditions such as pregnancy or menopause. Pregnancy. Many women notice some spotting in the first seven to ten days of being pregnant, when they are not yet aware of the pregnancy.During your menstrual cycle, the lining of your uterus thickens to get ready for pregnancy. Then, during your period, your body sheds the uterus lining along with blood. The amount of blood and fluid lost is usually between 4 and 12 teaspoons each cycle. The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days (counting from the first day of bleeding to the first day of the next cycle). For some women, though, cycles can be as short as 21 days. For others, they can be as long as 35 days. A normal period lasts between two and seven days. Many women have clots in their menstrual blood from time to time. The clots may be bright red or dark in color. Often, these clots are shed on the heaviest days of bleeding. The presence of multiple clots in your flow may make your menstrual blood seem thick or denser than usual.

how long do eggs have to boil to be hard boiled	Depending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly in 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more. Older eggs are easier to peel than fresh eggs. If you are planning to make hard boiled eggs for Easter and want to make sure that the eggs are easy to peel, buy your eggs at least a week ahead of time (two weeks even better, they'll keep). If you need easy-to-peel eggs and you have fresh eggs, you might want to try steaming the eggs for 15 minutes. Pour an inch of water into a pot and insert a steamer basket.Bring to a boil. Place the eggs in the steamer basket, cover and steam for 15 minutes (more or less, check!)Hard-cooked eggs in the shell can be refrigerated up to one week. Peeled hard boiled eggs can be stored in the refrigerator in a bowl of cold water to cover for about 1 week (change the water daily) - or in a sealed container without water (cover the eggs with damp paper towels) for the same length of time. An egg that is at room temperature at the start of the cooking process will require about 1 minute less cooking time than eggs taken directly from the refrigerator. 4. Technique for hard-cooking (boiled) eggs: Choose the right size pot to cook your eggs in: The eggs must not be stacked but be in one (1) layer only.
where does hardwood grow	For example, balsa wood is one of the lightest, least dense woods there is, and it's considered a hardwood. The distinction between hardwood and softwood actually has to do with plant reproduction. All trees reproduce by producing seeds, but the seed structure varies. Hardwood trees are angiosperms, plants that produce seeds with some sort of covering. This might be a fruit, such as an apple, or a hard shell, such as an acorn. Softwoods, on the other hand, are gymnosperms. These plants let seeds fall to the ground as is, with no covering. Evergreens do tend to be less dense than deciduous trees, and therefore easier to cut, while most hardwoods tend to be more dense, and therefore sturdier. But, as the classification of balsa wood demonstrates, there is no minimum weight requirement to becomeDeciduous Hardwoods These are the trees that lose their leaves in winter. They generally grow in temperate climates including the British Isles, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, Chile, and central U.S.A. Examples of Deciduous Hardwoods are:- Oak, Ash, Elm, Beech, Birch, Walnut, Sycamore, Chestnut and Lime. They grow much quicker than hardwoods and are cheaper, softer and easier to work. Their seeds are held in cones. common examples are:- Pine, Fir, Spruce, Larch, Cedar and the Giant Redwood. The terms softwoods and hardwoods are used to describe the leaves, seeds and structure of the trees.
what is trendelenburg gait	Trendelenburg Gait. A positive Trendelenburg gait (gluteus medius gait/lurching gait) is generally indicative of hip abductor weakness. The classic Trendelenburg's gait pattern is seen when the stance phase hip abductors cannot resist the pull of gravity on the unsupported swing phase lower extremity. The therapist will observe the swing phase pelvis dip below level. Treatment of Trendelenburg gait is by strengthening of the abductor muscles when possible. Treatment of the lurching gait pattern is by strongly encouraging patients to use forearm crutches, which will decrease both the energy of walking and the force on the joints in the lower extremities, especially the knee joint.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The Trendelenburg gait pattern (or gluteus medius lurch) is an abnormal gait (as with walking) caused by weakness of the abductor muscles of the lower limb, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. People with a lesion of superior gluteal nerve have weakness of abducting the thigh at the hip. This type of gait may also be seen in L5 radiculopathy and after poliomyelitis, but is then usually seen in combination with foot drop. This gait may be caused by cleidocranial dysostosis. Biofeedback and physical therapy have been used in treatment. When the hip abductor muscles (gluteus medius and minimus) are weak, the stabilizing effect of these muscles during gait is lost.
what percent of oxygen is considered anaerobic	A simple way to determine your maximum heart rate is by subtracting your age from the number 220; for women, the heart rate max calculation is more complex -- 206 minus 88 percent of your age. Working out in the aerobic zone has your heart pumping at between 70 percent and 80 percent of its maximum. Your anaerobic zone is somewhere between 80 percent and 90 percent of your MHR. For example, if you are 40-year-old woman, your MHR is 171. When you train within the aerobic zone, your heart beats between 120 and 137 beats per minute. Exercising in the anaerobic zone has your heart beating between 137 and 154 bpm. If you've just started an exercise program, don't push yourself into the anaerobic zone. ACE indicates that most healthy adults exercise so their heart beats between 50 percent and 80 percent of their MHR. When starting out, keep your target heart rate at the low end of this range, ACE advises.Anaerobic Zone. The anaerobic zone is slightly more intense than the aerobic zone. Anaerobic means without oxygen, so don't be surprised if you are unable to speak except for short words at a time in this zone. The anaerobic zone is 80 to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate. Aerobic Zone. The aerobic target zone is 70 to 80 percent of your maximal heart rate. Multiply your maximum heart rate by this percentage to determine the intensity you must maintain to remain in this zone.

how long do hammerhead sharks survive in captivity?	The life-span of tiger sharks in the wild is considered to be 27 years in average, even though some may live up to 50 years of age. As with other species, tiger sharks in captivity do not live as extensive as in wildlife reaching only 17 to 20 years. Some experts presume that the lifespan of the Great White Sharks is approximately 30 years (Levine, 1988) but other research indicates that they can reach up to 40 years. Lately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them. Shark lifespan vary by kind and it is very different for each of them. While many types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live much longer than others.The typical lifespan in the wild for Hammerhead Sharks is from 20 to 30 years approximately. Sandbar sharks or Brown sharks are considered to live between 20 and 30 years. Research made by Joung (2004) identified to be about 20 years of age. Some scientists believe that the life expectancy of the Great White Sharks is around 30 years (Levine, 1988) but other research indicates that they can reach up to 40 years. The lifespan of Tiger Sharks in the wild is believed to be 27 years in average, although some may live up to 50 years of age. Like with other species, tiger sharks in captivity do not live as lengthy as in wildlife reaching only 17 to 20 years
does the hypothalamus gland have hormones	The pituitary glands are made of the anterior lobe and posterior lobe. The anterior lobe produces and releases hormones. The posterior lobe does not produce hormones per se—this is done by nerve cells in the hypothalamus—but it does release them into the circulation. Hormones of the Pituitary Gland. The hormones of the pituitary gland send signals to other endocrine glands to stimulate or inhibit their own hormone production. For example, the anterior pituitary lobe will release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to stimulate cortisol production in the adrenal glands when you’re stressed.The hypothalamus (from Greek ὑπό, under and θάλαμος, room, chamber) is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis). The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus, just above the brainstem and is part of the limbic system. In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon. The hypothalamus is responsible for certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, often called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones
how are neurotransmitters inactivated	B. After a neurotransmitter molecule has been recognized by a post-synaptic receptor, it is released back into the synaptic cleft. Once in the synapse, it must be quickly removed or chemically inactivated in order to prevent constant stimulation of the post-synaptic cell and an excessive firing of action potentials. Some neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by special transporter proteins on the pre-synaptic membrane. Neuropeptide neurotransmitters merely quickly diffuse away from the receptors into the surrounding medium. One important neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, has a specialized enzyme for inactivation right in the synaptic cleft called acetylcholinesterase (AChE.A B After a neurotransmitter molecule has been recognized by a post-synaptic receptor, it is released back into the synaptic cleft.

what happens after colon cancer diagnosis	How cancer grows and spreads. Cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in the body. These extra cells grow together and form masses, called tumors. In colorectal cancer, these growths usually start as polyps in the large intestine (colon or rectum). If colon polyps aren't found and removed, they may turn into cancer. Cancers in the colon or rectum usually grow very slowly. It takes most of them years to become large enough to cause symptoms. If the cancer is allowed to grow, over time it will invade and destroy nearby tissues and then spread farther. Colorectal cancer spreads first to nearby lymph nodeThe process used to find out if cancer has spread within the colon or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: 1  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, pelvis, or chest, taken from different angles. 1 Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. 2  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. 3  Surgery: A procedure to remove the tumor and see how far it has spread through the colon.

average length of a school day in the us	That headline caught my attention as I expect it would most education support professionals (ESPs) and teachers. While most school days average 6.5 hours, the article said that Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts was experimenting with an 8-hour school day, one of only 10 states to do so. Consult Everyone. In my particular school an 8-hour school day would force most students to get up at 5:30 a.m., board a bus at 6:30 a.m., and arrive at school at 7:30 a.m. Then, put in eight hours of class, leave at about 4:00 p.m. and return home at 5:00 p.m. This would mean that the students would be putting in almost 12-hour days.The average school day in the United States varies from state to state, but most stays require approximately 180 days for the school year to be complete. Each state’s Department of Education determines its own minimum school day length and stipulations for fulfilling the 180 days. The way states add this time up can get complicated, but typically if schools or districts choose to add time to the legal minimum school day, the day would be considered extended. “It was exhausting,” he says of those first two years. But, the school was “able to offer longer class periods, build in restroom breaks and student celebrations, and provide teachers with time for meetings and planning time inside the school day so that we had less out-of-school-time meetings.”.
function of starch in pasta	Answers. Best Answer: Starch is a carbohydrate; it provides energy for our bodies and is converted to sugar during digestion. Complex carbs are better because they do not spike the blood sugar, but provide hours of consistent energy instead.Research a starch's glycemic index for how healthy it is.Quinoa and oats are better carbs, as opposed to white wheat flour, and dwarf whole wheat. Book: Wheat Belly. Because of how a lot of starches cook, they make good breads & pastas.omplex carbs are better because they do not spike the blood sugar, but provide hours of consistent energy instead. Research a starch's glycemic index for how healthy it is. Quinoa and oats are better carbs, as opposed to white wheat flour, and dwarf whole wheat.The starch found in pasta is made of long chains of glucose. The nutritional value of a pasta dish varies depending on the type of pasta, the serving size and the different toppings used.Almost all pasta is made from durum or wheat, which is rich in carbohydrates.There are various types of carbohydrates present in the food you eat, but the main ones are starches, sugars such as glucose and fructose, as well as fiber.lucose. Although glucose is not found in its free form in pasta, it is present as an integral component of starches. Starches are made of 100 percent glucose. Single molecules of glucose attached in long strings are what form starches.
what is adco-simvastatin used for	It is used along with exercise, diet, and weight loss to decrease elevated lipid levels. It is also used to decrease the risk of heart problems in those at high risk. The primary uses of simvastatin are for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction have not improved cholesterol levels sufficiently. Simvastatin is a powerful lipid-lowering drug that can decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels by up to 50%. It is used in doses of 5 to 80 mg. In secondary prevention, 80 mg per day reduced major cardiovascular events by an absolute rate of 1.2% compared with 20 mg per day in a randomized controlled trial.High Cholesterol or Triglycerides Treatment. Simvastatin is used for treating high cholesterol in those people who cannot lower cholesterol through lifestyle changes alone. Simvastatin can lower total cholesterol and LDL ( bad cholesterol ) and increase HDL ( good cholesterol ). Simvastatin has also been shown to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. Simvastatin is a medicine that has been licensed to treat several conditions. These Simvastatin uses are as follows: 1  Treatment of high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia). 2  Treatment of high triglycerides. 3  Prevention of heart or blood vessel disease (known as cardiovascular disease).
average temp in thar desert	The average annual rainfall of the region varies from 100 to 500 mm, it is distributed very erratically, occurring mostly between July and September. The mean average temperature varies from a minimum of 24 degrees C to 26 degrees C in summer to 4 degrees C to 10 degrees C in winter. One unique feature of this desert is that there is neither an oasis in it nor any artesian well. No native cactus or palm tree breaks the monotony of the vast expanse. T he origin of the Thar desert is a controversial subject. Some consider it to be only 4000 to 10,000 years old, whereas others state that aridity started in this region much earlier.Bikaner experiences a very hot temperature with the average high of 44°C in the summer months, April to early November. May is the hottest month of the year when the city gets around 50°C of average high. Moreover, as the city situated in the Thar Desert, it gets very poor level of precipitation. July, the wettest month of the year gets not more than 100mm of rainfall. However, temperature falls dramatically during the winter months. During January, the coldest month of the year, the average low drops below 5°C. Bikaner, a district in Rajasthan, India, goes through a very hot temperature since it is located in the center of the Thar Desert. Usually, with a little variation it experiences two major seasons, an extremely hot summer and a mild winter.
travelling before baby has injections	You will need to have two hepatitis A injections for your body to develop full immunity to the infection. You should have a booster dose six to 12 months after the first. It’s best to have the first injection about two weeks before you travel, but it’s possible to have it the day before you leave. The vaccine (if the booster dose is given) can give up to 30 years of protection. In the UK, you will usually have had the tetanus vaccine as part of your routine childhood immunisations, unless you were born before 1961 when the UK-wide vaccine programme started. Make sure that you have had the full course of injections – three initial injections with two boosters.A single dose of hepatitis A vaccine is usually given as primary vaccination and then a booster dose can be given 6-12 months after the first vaccination to prolong its effect. Ideally, the vaccination should be given 4 weeks before travel. A combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is also available in Australia. It is given as a course of 3 doses of vaccine: one vaccination is given immediately, the second is given one month later, and the third is given 5 months after that. Hepatitis A immunisation is used as a preventive treatment (prophylaxis) for this disease. You should discuss with your doctor or travel medicine professional whether this vaccination is relevant to the areas in which you will be travelling.

why does the tricuspid valve fail	Tricuspid insufficiency (TI) , a valvular heart disease also called tricuspid regurgitation (TR), refers to the failure of the heart's tricuspid valve to close properly during systole. As a result, with each heart beat some blood passes from the right ventricle to the right atrium, the opposite of the normal direction. Tricuspid regurgitation occurs in roughly less than 1% of people and is usually asymptomatic, but may also be a feature of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. The result is incompetence of the tricuspid valve. Left ventricular failure is, in turn, the most common cause of right ventricular dilation. Other common causes of right ventricular dilation include right ventricular infarction, inferior myocardial infarction and cor pulmonale.Physicians who treat this condition. Valvular heart disease is characterized by damage to or a defect in one of the four heart valves: the mitral, aortic, tricuspid or pulmonary. The mitral and tricuspid valves control the flow of blood between the atria and the ventricles (the upper and lower chambers of the heart). The pulmonary valve controls the flow of blood from the heart to the lungs, and the aortic valve governs blood flow between the heart and the aorta, and thereby the blood vessels to the rest of the body. The mitral and aortic valves are the ones most frequently affected by valvular heart disease.
During what cycle are sugars produced in the chloroplast?	This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek φῶς, phōs, light, and σύνθεσις, synthesis, putting together. In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. In the light-independent (or dark) reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin-Benson cycle that requires the newly formed NADPH, releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch.In C4 plants the photosynthesis takes place in a chloroplast of a thin-walled mesophyll cell and a 4-carbon acid is handed off to a thick-walled bundle sheath cell where the Calvin cycle occurs in a chloroplast of that second cell. This protects the Calvin cycle from the effects of photorespiration. In this way, carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil in a more disordered state are combined to form the more ordered sugar molecules. Carbon dioxide is captured in a cycle of reactions known as the Calvin cycle or the Calvin-Benson cycle after its discoverers. It is also known as just the C 3 cycle. Those plants that utilize just the Calvin cycle for carbon fixation are known as C3 plants. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the stroma of chloroplasts and combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose1,5-biphosphate (RuBP)

what is gene deletion	People with a 22q11.2 deletion have a very small piece of chromosome 22 missing; that's why the disorder is called a deletion.. The q11.2 tells everyone who works in genetics that the missing piece is in a very specific spot on the q arm — also called the long arm — of the chromosome. Chromosome 22q11.2 Deletion. The chromosome 22q11.2 deletion is a chromosomal difference that may or may not run in the family (meaning it's hereditary). The condition is present in approximately one out of every 9,000 live births, and in 5-8 percent of children born with cleft palate.Deletion on a chromosome. In genetics, a deletion (also called gene deletion, deficiency, or deletion mutation) (sign: δ) is a mutation (a genetic aberration) in which a part of a chromosome or a sequence of DNA is lost during DNA replication. Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome. The smallest single base deletion mutations are believed occur by a single base flipping in the template DNA, followed by template DNA strand slippage, within the DNA polymerase active site. 1 ' Terminal Deletion' — a deletion that occurs towards the end of a chromosome. 2  Intercalary Deletion / Interstitial Deletion — a deletion that occurs from the interior of a chromosome. 3  Microdeletion — a relatively small amount of deletion (up to 5Mb that could include a dozen genes).
modern definition of democracy	And unlike ancient democracy it believes in universal adult franchise, all adults have right to vote. SO the definition of MODERN DEMOCRACY is a form of government, where a constitution guarantees basic personal and political rights, fair and free elections, and independent courts of law.. Best Answer: Democracy actually originated in Greece. the word Democracy is derived from the Greek: δημοκρατία - (dēmokratia) dēmokratía the power to the people which was coined from (δῆμος) demos dêmos people (and) κράτος, Kratos krátos power a form of democracy Was practised In athens and rome which granted power. to the citizensLinks. A Short Definition of Democracy U.S. president Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) defined democracy as: «Government of the people, by the people, for the people» Democracy is by far the most challenging form of government-both for politicians and for the people. The term democracy comes from the Greek language and means  rule by the (simple) people. The so-called democracies in classical antiquity (Athens and Rome) represent precursors of modern democracies. Like modern democracy, they were created as a reaction to a concentration and abuse of power by the rulers. The term democracy comes from the Greek language and means rule by the (simple) people.

what does diatomic mean	Diatomic molecules are molecules composed of only two atoms, of either the same or different chemical elements. The prefix di-is of Greek origin, meaning two. If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen (H 2) or oxygen (O 2), then it is said to be homonuclear. Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide (NO), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear. The only chemical elements that form stable homonuclear diatomic molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (or typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25 °C) are the gases hydrogen (H 2), nitrogen (N 2), oxygen (O 2), fluorine (F 2), and chlorine (Cl 2).Diatomic molecules are molecules made of two atoms chemically bonded together. The atoms can be of the same element (homonuclear molecules), or of different elements (heteronuclear molecules). Familiar examples of diatomic molecules of elements are the five gaseous state diatomic elements: Cl 2, F 2 H 2, N 2 ,and O 2. Bonding in Diatomic Molecules. In homonuclear diatomic molecules, the bonding is covalent. Each atom in the molecule has equal electronegativity; electrons are shared equally between the two atoms. In heteronuclear diatomic molecules, the atoms differ in electronegativity; these molecules have polar covalent bonds. The molecule forms a dipole
what is a muskrat	The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), the only species in genus Ondatra and tribe Ondatrini, is a medium-sized semiaquatic rodent native to North America, and is an introduced species in parts of Europe, Asia, and South America. The muskrat is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. It has important effects on the ecology of wetlands and is a resource of food and fur for humans. The muskrat is the largest species in the subfamily Arvicolinae, which includes 142 other species of rodents, mostly voles and lemmings. Muskrats are referred to as  rats  in a general sense because they are medium-sized rodents with an adaptable lifestyle and an omnivorous dietThe muskrat's name probably comes by folk etymology from a word of Algonquin origin, muscascus (literally it is red, so called for its colorings), or from the Abenaki native word moskwas, mòskwas as seen in the Archaic english name for the, animal. musquash The muskrat is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats.

how long does it take for sweet corn to germinate	Corn is a warm-season annual that is best planted after the soil temperature reaches 60°F, usually two or three weeks after the last frost in spring. Corn planted in cold, wet soil is unlikely to germinate. Corn grows best in air temperatures from 60° to 95°F. Corn can take from 60 to 100 days to reach harvest depending upon variety and the amount of heat during the growing season. Corn seed germinates in 10 to 14 days at 75°F, but the rate of germination may reach only 75 percent. Start corn indoors 2 to 3 weeks before the last frost in spring for transplanting 2 to 3 weeks after the last frost. If your season is long enough, plant successive crops every two to three weeks. Planting and spacing.Fresh sweet corn can be worth the wait. Gardeners usually plant corn (Zea mays) 10 days to two weeks after the last spring frost, when the soil temperature begins to warm. If corn is planted when the soil temperature is 60 F, then corn sprouts typically break the soil surface in 10 days to two weeks. If you planted sweet corn and two weeks passed without sight of the first green shoot, then several factors may have caused the delay. Soil temperature is one of the best predictors of how long it will take corn to break the ground's surface. Soil temperature is usually 5 to 10 degrees cooler than air temperature, and soil temperature increases slower than air temperature in spring.
nba draft combine	The NBA Draft Combine started Wednesday in Chicago, and here are all the pre-draft measurements you need and crave. The measurements they take are pretty reasonable -- weight, standing reach, wingspan, hand length -- but there's one weird thing: They measure the prospects both in shoes and without shoes. But the NBA opts to measure both, and releases them. The data helps us learn that there are no true 7-footers in the draft, only shoed 7-footers. It teaches us most potential NBA players wear shoes between one and two inches. Oklahoma's TaShawn Thomas wears shoes that are but a flimsy .75 inches thick.Although the NBA Draft Combine is the largest pre-draft gathering for testing and drills, international players can attend a separate Eurocamp at a later date. Parts of the combine are televised on ESPNU and ESPN2. In 2013, Rudy Gobert set the Combine records for wingspan 7 feet 8.5 inches (2.35 m) and standing reach 9 feet 7 inches (2.92 m). D. J. Stephens set the vertical leap record in 2013 at 46 inches (1.17 m). Combine results may or may not affect draft position. The athletic tests include a standing vertical jump, maximum vertical jump, bench press, three-quarter-court sprint time, lane agility time, and modified event time. Physical measurements include height with shoes, height without shoes, wingspan, weight, standing reach, body fat, hand length, and hand width.

how many people have gambling addiction	According to research, around 80% of adults have gambled, which is a striking number of people who have participated in the activity. Of this 80%, two or three percent of these people have experienced a gambling problem. This may not seem like much, but if you break it down in actually numbers, it is quite a few. For example, in the United States alone there are 310,574,859. This means that 62,114,971 people in the United States alone have gambled. Of this, approximately 1,242,299 have an addiction to gambling. A problem with gambling is comparable to a problem with drugs or other addictions. And because of this, more people find it harder and harder to stop gambling. Others believe that the dangers of gambling such as addiction are not preached enough meaning that the majority of people do not even realize that they could haveOf those, around 300,000 or 0.9 per cent of the total, were problem gamblers. The British Gambling Prevalence Study, which is published on Wednesday, is likely to show that this last figure has now risen to two per cent of a total of at least 40 million who gamble regularly. By Mark Choueke. 12:01AM BST 16 Sep 2007. The number of people with severe gambling problems is fast approaching one million, experts fear. Research is expected to reveal this week that as many as one in 50 of the adult population who gamble regularly are hopelessly addicted.
eccentric definition anatomy	It's also important to note there are two types of isotonic contractions. Concentric contraction occurs when the muscle shortens, while eccentric contraction occurs when the muscle lengthens. Let me explain. Let's re-examine our weight lifter. The muscle shortens when the arm flexes at the elbow in the act of curling-therefore, this is a concentric contraction. Isotonic Contraction. Isotonic literally means 'same tension,' where 'iso'- means 'the same' and 'tonic' refers to 'tension or force' - in this case, in the muscle. In an isotonic contraction, tension develops to a point and then remains constant while the muscle changes its length.eccentric contraction, a type of muscle contraction that occurs as the muscle fibers lengthen, such as when a weight is lowered through a range of motion. The contractile force generated by the muscle is weaker than an opposing force, which causes the muscle to stretch. isotonic contraction muscle contraction without appreciable change in the force of contraction; the distance between the origin and insertion becomes lessened. lengthening contraction eccentric contraction. postural contraction the state of muscular tension and contraction that just suffices to maintain the posture of the body. segmental c's muscular contractions of the small intestine that serve to mix and transport chyme. shortening contraction concentric contraction
how many points to be a doctor	Confidence votes 53. The system has just changed last year, so it's more than points you need. There are three criteria to fulfil: Leaving Cert points, subjects, and HPAT score. Leaving Cert points normally work on a supply and demand principle, but for Medicine they are fixed and have a special arrangement. You need to have a minimum of 480 to be eligible. Note that once you reach 550 though, the points become less important. Every subsequent 5 points is reduced to 1 e.g. 565 becomes 553, up to 600, which becomes 560(max). This does not affect your points for other courses. There may be other courses, but the … re is little chance of having a career out of it in this country. Edit: Due to the new initiative of 25 points for higher level maths, you can expect at least an increase of 25 points compared to last year, which was 425 in 2011/2012.Becoming a doctor takes time. Usually four years of undergraduate studies, four years of medical school, then 3-6 years of residency (depending on your specialty). That's an average of twelve years from starting college to practicing medicine. However, if helping others is important to you, but being a doctor is not the right fit, there are many other physician career options you can consider. And keep in mind that politicians, religious leaders, and social workers all have the opportunity to help others, perhaps in larger numbers.

how much does a gas heater cost to run	Based on the U.S. average price of $1.15 per therm of natural gas as of the publication date, the U.S. Energy Information Institute estimates that 1 million Btu of heat costs about $14.02. This figure assumes an average gas furnace efficiency of 82 percent. In California, natural gas costs $9.20 per thousand cubic feet, or 90 cents per therm, according to the EIA. At this price it would cost $10.98 to generate 1 million Btu of heat using an 82 percent efficient furnace. While more than 70 percent of California residents rely on gas for heating, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, another 22 percent turn to electricity to heat the home. When considering a gas furnace, it may be helpful to compare the cost of operating a gas furnace to the cost of electric heating.1 Prices of gas wall heaters vary depending on the design and energy output. 2  A 30,000 BTU vent free natural gas wall heater can cost $100 to $450 and can provide heat of up to a 1,000 square foot space. 3  A 6,000 BTU LP gas wall heater will provide sufficient heat for a moderate room. 1 A 30,000 BTU vent free natural gas wall heater can cost $100 to $450 and can provide heat of up to a 1,000 square foot space. 2  A 6,000 BTU LP gas wall heater will provide sufficient heat for a moderate room. 3  This is an ideal source for primary or secondary source of heating. 4  These can be purchased from $250 to $460
what organs are affected by diabetes insipidus	Diabetes Mellitus affects the pancreas and Diabetes Insipidus affects the kidneys. Diabetes Mellitus is a condition that causes the pancreas to produce little or no insulin. Also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, type 2 diabetes. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is unrelated to diabetes mellitus and has nothing to do with glucose. The symptoms include excessive thirst and constant urination because of the inability of the kidneys to regulate fluid. It its most common form, called central diabetes insipidus, it is caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In the second most common type, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is is caused by the kidneys being insensitive to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It can also be caused by prescribed medications1 Diabetes Insipidus: Rare pituitary disorder often affecting the kidneys. 2  Diabetes Insipidus: metabolic disorder due to injury of the neurohypophyseal system; results in deficient quanity of antidiuretic hormone being released or produced, failure of tubular reabsorption of water in the kidney. 3  Source-Diseases Database. Types of Diabetes Insipidus: 1  Central Diabetes Insipidous-most common type, caused by pituitary gland. 2  Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidous-kidney dysfunction. 3  Autoimmune Diabetes Insipidous-caused by an autoimmune reaction. 4  Dipsogenic Diabetes Insipidous-hypothalamus damage causing abnormal thirst
what is the common name of the northern cardinal	Scientific name: Cardinalis cardinalis Common name: Northern Cardinal. (Information in this Species Page was compiled by Tim Burg in Spring, 2001 and Mindy Beale in Spring 2004 for Biology 220W at Penn State New Kensington). Appearance. The northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) is one of the most recognized birds of North America. The bright red body feathers and distinctive black mask of the male and the more subdued but equally elegant olive brown and red-tinted females stand out clearly in their wide range of preferred habitats.lso, cowbirds are common nest parasites, and northern cardinals complete with catbirds and mockingbirds for nesting sites. On average, northern cardinals live for 3 years in the wild although several individuals have had life spans of 13 to 15 years. The longevity record for a captive northern cardinal is 28 ½ years!The northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) is a North American bird in the genus Cardinalis; it is also known colloquially as the redbird or common cardinal. It can be found in southern Canada, through the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and south through Mexico. It is found in woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps. The northern cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of 21 cm (8.3 in). It has a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face which is black in the male and gray in the female
where is gnrh originated	At the pituitary, GnRH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). These processes are controlled by the size and frequency of GnRH pulses, as well as by feedback from androgens and estrogens. Low-frequency GnRH pulses are required for FSH release, whereas high-frequency GnRH pulses stimulate LH pulses in a one to one manner. GnRH is found in organs outside of the hypothalamus and pituitary, and its role in other life processes is poorly understood. For instance, there is likely to be a role for GnRH1 in the placenta and in the gonads. GnRH and GnRH receptors are also found in cancers of the breast, ovary, prostate, and endometrium.Overview of hypothalamic–gonadotrope development. (a) Migration of gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from the olfactory placode to the fetal hypothalamus. (b) Differentiation of the specific cell lineages in the developing anterior pituitary gland. The gonadotropins, FSH and LH, are heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones released in pulses from the pituitary gonadotrope cells. FSH and LH secretion is regulated by hypothalamic GnRH, which itself is pulsatile. GnRH‐secreting neurons originate in the olfactory placode and migrate to the hypothalamus during development; defects affecting neuronal migration can be associated with a lack of smell (anosmia)
temperature and time to roast turkey breast	1 Place your turkey in the oven. 2  When the turkey is about ⅔ done, loosely cover breast and top of drumsticks with a piece of foil to prevent overcooking. 3  Your turkey is done when the temperature with a meat thermometer is 180° F in thigh and 165° F in breast or stuffing. Roast uncovered according to Cooking Schedule or until meat thermometer in thickest part of breast reaches 170° F. If breast is stuffed, center of stuffing should be 165° F. 2  Roasting time will vary if turkey is covered or placed in an oven-cooking bag.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Rub the turkey all over with the butter, including the cavity of the breast. Season generously with salt and pepper. Scatter the vegetables on the bottom of a roasting pan just large enough to hold the turkey. Set the meat breast-side up in the pan.Roast for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast registers 160 degrees F.

Scatter the vegetables on the bottom of a roasting pan just large enough to hold the turkey. Set the meat breast-side up in the pan.
what is stereotactic radiation therapy	Stereotactic radiation therapy. Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external beam radiation therapy. Stereo means 3-dimensional (3-D) and tactic means to probe. Stereotactic radiation therapy allows radiation beams to be given to a very specific area, usually the brain. There are 2 ways to deliver stereotactic radiation therapy treatment. 1  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers a single high dose of radiation to the tumour (called a single fraction). People receiving stereotactic radiation therapy to the brain wear a special head frame (stereotactic frame) during their treatment. 1  When SRS is used, the head frame is attached to the skull. 2  When SRT is used, a removable head frame or a special face mask keeps the head in position.Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position the patient and precisely deliver radiation to a tumor. The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. Stereotactic radiation therapy is used to treat brain tumors and other brain disorders. It is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer, such as lung cancer. Also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy. What differentiates Stereotactic from conventional radiotherapy is the precision with which it is delivered.
how to manage anger and depression	Anger is a normal, healthy emotion. But managing anger can be a problem for many people who find it difficult to keep their anger under control. Health issues linked to unresolved anger include high blood pressure, heart attack, depression, anxiety, colds, flu and problems with digestion. But anger doesn’t have to be a problem. Bring down your general stress levels with exercise and relaxation. Running, walking, swimming, yoga and meditation are just a few of the activities that can help reduce stress. Exercise as part of your daily life is a good way to get rid of irritation and anger,” says Isabel.It's a way of making others pay for your emotional deficits. It is wise to change that tendency. Whether or not anger fuels depression, it isn't good for the enjoyment of life. Here are ways to keep anger from feeding your depression. 1  First, of course, is to identify anger and to acknowledge it. 2  Anger is one of those emotions whose expression is sometimes subject to taboos so that people can grow up unable to recognize it; they feel its physical discomfort but can't label it. 1 If you have a word for your emotional state, then you can begin to deal with it. 2  Feelings are fluid; you need to stop and capture them in a word, or else you lose them and don't know you have them. 3  A label improves your ability to understand your feelings. 4  View your anger as a signal.

how do penguins get their food	Penguins play a cat-and-mouse-game with their prey. They start looking for fish by diving at a rate of 5 till 10 km/hr and under an angle of 5 degree till 85 degrees. On a certain depth they either swim a while horizontally or they ascend again under the same angle. Of course the fish tries to escape. While penguins need air to breath, they have to go to the surface of the water after a few minutes. Luckily for them, their prey can't dive deeper either, because the lack on oxygen and food so deep in the water. To find out when and where penguins eat what, scientists of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut fuer Für-polar Und meeresforschung developed a special. Sensor a penguin is an-warm blooded (animal body temperature is about°39), c but their prey has only a temperature of -about °2 c + till °13. cHow They Drink. Penguins drink the same way most birds do: by swallowing water. Although that's nothing special, penguins often have little choice but to swallow saltwater. When they're swimming in the ocean, they use their strong beaks to catch fish and other prey. Some even eat snow as a source of water. Penguins in zoos live in fresh water, and some species, such as rockhopper penguins, prefer to live around fresh water instead of saltwater. The supraorbital gland serves only one purpose -- to filter salt from the blood -- so it's not used when penguins drink only fresh water.
what did abraham do to stop slavery	The BBC programme, ‘Abraham Lincoln: Saint or Sinner’ argues that this changed Lincoln. In 1863, his final Emancipation Proclamation frees the slaves. And by the end of the war, it is likely that Lincoln is committed to not just ending slavery, but ensuring full citizenship to the ‘black race’. Less than a week after Robert E. Lee effectively surrenders the Confederacy, Lincoln is assassinated. “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.”. But the confederacy has already been born. Slave rebellions, religion and politics had failed to abolish slavery.Abraham Lincoln' s position on slavery is one of the central issues in American history. Lincoln often expressed moral opposition to slavery in public and private. Initially, he expected to bring about the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any U.S. territory, and by proposing compensated emancipation (an offer Congress applied to Washington, D.C.) in his early presidency. In the 1850s, Lincoln was politically attacked as an abolitionist, but he did not consider himself one; he did not call for the immediate end of slavery everywhere in the U.S. until the proposed 13th Amendment became part of his party platform for the 1864 election.
how bad canceling a credit card affect your score	Your FICO Score. Before determining whether canceling your credit card is detrimental to your FICO score, it is important to understand what a FICO score is. This score is a calculated figure that lenders, employers, landlords and others use to determine your creditworthiness. Your score can be broken down into five key areas: This will have a tremendous impact on your score. The amounts that you owe will also play an important factor in the determination of your FICO score and should be considered. Canceling credit cards will not adversely affect your score much. It will impact your credit score but the potential result is negligible, and therefore it is not worth paying annual fees or dues simply to maintain an open line of credit. Maintaining a card that has no activity is essentially pointless.Closing credit cards will never help your credit score. The question is if closing accounts will hurt your credit score.

what are five places where carbon is stored	Aboveground – Carbon is stored in the leaves, stems, and other parts of plants when they absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere and use it to grow. Trees are very important for carbon sequestration because they live a long time and can store their carbon for many years. Long-lived products – Wood and other products made from trees still contain the carbon absorbed by the plants that they came from. When a tree is utilized for wood, its ability to sequester carbon is extended, and the carbon is not released until the product burns or decomposes.Carbon is also found in the atmosphere where it's a part of carbon dioxide gas emitted when fossil fuels are burned and when living organisms breathe. It's in organic matter in the soil, and it's in rocks. But far and away the most carbon on Earth is stored in a surprising place: the ocean. There's estimated to be 38,000 to 40,000 billion metric tons of carbon in the ocean itself with a whopping 66 million to 100 million-billion metric tons of carbon in marine sediments and sedimentary rocks. It's enough to leave anyone wondering just what the heck carbon is and where the Earth is keeping all of it. Carbon is a chemical element, and a pretty common one. It's the sixth most common element in the universe and the 15th most common one in the Earth's crust. Unlike a lot of other chemical elements, you can actually see some forms of carbon
price for a new passport us	The cost of a passport can vary depending on the type of service you require, how quickly you need to get the application processed and any additional services you might need. There is an application fee for most services ranging from only $15 for a passport card for a minor to $110 for a new passport or renewal. An execution fee of $25 is mandatory when submitting Form DS-11. This is paid to the agent that adjudicates the application. The fees for some of the optional services are $60 for expedited service, $14.85 for overnight delivery of your new passport and $150 for a file search. The lowest possible price would be about $50 for the renewal of a passport card for an adult. This would include the application fee, passport photo and postage. The highest amount an applicant might spend to get a passport can reach $750 or more.Other passport fees are also expected to rise later this year. For those under 16, the cost of a passport could be $105. Passport renewal may jump to $110. But if you’ll be in a hurry to get to Paris or that Bermuda beach, the additional fee for expedited passport services is likely to remain at $60. It could cost you a little more to get one. Later this year, the State Department could charge an adult – anyone 16 and older – $135 for a first-time passport. For the past two years, the charge has been $100 (and it was $97 before February 2008).
who are the saviors on twd	Negan is a fictional character in the comic book series The Walking Dead. He is the leader of a group of over 50 survivors in Washington, DC called the Saviors, who subjugate other communities in the area for resources in return for their protection against zombies. Negan has a unique personality; a purer form of sociopathic typification than the Governor, who had psychotic tendencies and often engaged in emotional outbursts. Negan is as feared and respected as a king, seen as the first and last word on the activities of his group, the Saviors.Rick and Andrea chased the Saviors to kill them, but instead of finding any of them, they found Abraham's corpse being gnawed on by a zombie. After they disposed of the zombie, they brought back Abraham's body for burial in Issue 98. Late in Issue 99, a small group of Saviors spied on the colony with one Savior telling the others to inform Negan that they will attack at dawn. Rick led a group of Community survivors which included Michonne, Carl, Glenn, Maggie, Sophia, and Heath to the Hilltop Colony following the death of Abraham. At some point during the night, a group of four Saviors snuck up on their vehicle and captured Rick. His captor ended up being the Savior who Rick had let live earlier in order to deliver a message to Negan. The group of four alerted Negan, along with a bulky group of Saviors in the area, that they ha
could i catch mrsa from a lady whose leg is weeping?	Bacterial Causes. Lower leg cellulitis is a disease induced by bacteria-Streptococcus. The group A of this bacteria is the most common cause of infections on the lower leg in otherwise healthy adults. It is usually found on the skin and in the throat.Some other cause of cellulitis in the lower leg in adults is a bacteria Staphylococcus Aureus, usually found on human skin and mouth and nose lining (also known as mucosa).The most common cause of lower leg cellulitis in children under 3 years old is Haemophilus Influenzae type B (Hib) .acterial Causes. Lower leg cellulitis is a disease induced by bacteria-Streptococcus. The group A of this bacteria is the most common cause of infections on the lower leg in otherwise healthy adults. It is usually found on the skin and in the throat.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is another type of infection that may affect a person's leg. Caused by a strain of staph and resistant to antibiotics, MRSA starts out as small, reddened bumps that eventually turn into a deep, inflamed, puss-filled section of the skin.f a person suspects he has an infected leg, he should see a doctor for a diagnosis and treatment recommendation. Some seemingly minor infections can become severe if left untreated or if they’re treated with the wrong types of medication. One type of infection that may affect a person’s leg is called cellulitis.
cost to plant grapes per acre	Yield is roughly 5 tons per acre, on mature vines (3-4 years old). The average price of Sonoma grapes is just under $2,000 per ton (higher in some areas, lower in others). Each acre should generate $10,000 + in revenue annually. After deducting the farming costs that leaves roughly $7,000 +/- $500 revenue. If you were to invest in a 10 acre farm the cost of the initial investment (excluding land price) would likely be $250,000. Add in the cost of land (at about $100,000 per acre) you are up to $1,250,000 initial investment. Assuming some mix of equity and loans 40/60 is typical you would be servicing about about $600,000 in debt over a 20 year period = $4500/month or $54,000/ year. Back to yields: If you plant a mix of grapes and can manage to yield $2,500 per acre you will generate about $125,000 per year in revenue.Regional comparison. By comparison, a similar costs report in Napa County for 1,555 vines per acre yielding 4.5 tons per acre would result in total cash costs per acre of $31,983, $5,212 and $5,251 for the first three years, but the income would total $4,455 per acre (with 1 ton in the third year.). Sixty acres of vines being replanted are the basis of this study; the farm also has 135 acres of mature vineyards in production. Roads, irrigation systems, fencing and farmstead occupy 5 acres of the property. Land in this area costs $11,000-$30,000 per acre.
blood is correctly classified as a	Blood is a highly specialized, fluid tissue. Blood is traditionally classified as a specialized form of connective tissue. To appreciate the basic unity of blood and other varieties of connective tissue, consider the following. 1  All of the several blood cell types originate in the connective tissue of bone marrow. Because blood is so easily sampled, and because many readily observable features of blood are altered in specific ways by disease processes, examination of blood cells can be extremely informative. Modern laboratories provide automated analysis in the form of a CBC, or complete blood count.Hemophilia is a rare, typically inherited, bleeding disorder that can range from mild to severe, depending on how much clotting factor is present in the blood. Hemophilia is classified as Type A or Type B, based on which type of clotting factor is lacking (factor VIII in Type A and factor IX in Type B). Hemophilia results from a genetic defect found on the X chromosome. It is usually milder than hemophilia and can affect both males and females. Women are especially affected by von WIllebrand disease during menses. Von Willebrand disease is classified into three different types (Types 1, 2, and 3), based on the levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII activity in the blood. Type 1 is the mildest and most common form; Type 3 is the most severe and least common form
what are diseases caused by bacteria	Conversely, a number of diseases that impact humans are caused by bacteria. Bacteria that cause disease are called pathogenic bacteria, and they do so by producing poisonous substances called endotoxins and exotoxins. These substances are responsible for the symptoms that occur with bacteria related diseases. The symptoms may range from mild to serious, and some can be deadly. Cholera is an intestinal infection caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. Cholera is a food-borne disease typically spread by food and water contaminated with Vibrio cholerae. Around the world, approximately 3 to 5 million cases per year with approximately 100,000 plus deaths occur.Bacteria causes many diseases such as whooping cough, diarrhoea, typhoid fever, bacterial pneumonia and many more! :). When bacteria in the body and cause disease, hence this phenomenon is called infection. Diseases caused depending on the type and place of occurrence of bacterial infections. An example is typhoid, caused by the bacterium Salmonella thypi. Other bacteria is tuberculosis bacterium, which attacks the lungs causing TB disease, and if spread to the brain, can cause meningitis. In general bacteria that cause disease are called pathogenic bacteria.

average training cost per employee	Similar to the direct learning expenditure per employee, the cost per learning hour available slightly increased from 2012 to 2013. In 2013, organizations report that the cost to have one hour of learning available was $1,798, which is a 1.5 percent increase over 2012, or $26. Healthcare/pharmaceutical organizations spend on average $1,392 and provide 24 hours of training per employee. The combined group of finance, insurance, and real estate spend on average $1,107 and provide 33 hours of training per employee. (See Figure 2,  Direct Learning Expenditure per Employee by Industry .).Training turns out to be one of the costliest investments a company can make. In a report from Training magazine in 2007, companies spent an average of over $1,200 annually per employee. In 2005, employees spent an average of 32 hours per year on training. And those aren't necessarily only new hires who would not only require the same on-the-job training and continuing education as current employees, but the additional hours and cost of orientation and initial job training. The level goes up to 50% productivity for weeks 5 through 12, with corresponding cost of 50% of employee salary. Weeks 13 -20 usually bring the employee up to 75% productivity rate, with the cost being 25% of employee salary. Around the five-month mark, then, companies can expect a new hire to reach full productivity.
what civilization invented the wheel	Along with the various other inventions Mesopotamia is well known for the unique and an important invention of the wheels. The wheels were invented by the Sumerians around 3500 BC. The wheel is a cylinder shaped object that rolls fairly easily. The first wheel was made from clay, rock and mud which slowly developed to the making of wheels by joining together of wooden planks. They connected it to vehicles called chariots. It was one of the biggest achievements in history. The earliest known use of this essential invention was a potter's wheel that was used at Ur in Mesopotamia as early as 3500 BC. The first use of the wheel for transportation was on Mesopotamian chariots in 3200 BC.Nevertheless, the wheel (specifically as a means of transportation) was actually invented at a relatively late point of human history. The oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia, and dates to around 3500 BC. This period was known as the Bronze Age, which is a relatively late chapter in the story of the development of human civilisation. One of the reasons why the wheel was invented only at this point in history is due to the fact that metal tools were needed to chisel fine-fitted holes and axles. This leads to the next reason – the wheel was not just a cylinder rolling on its edge. It was a cylinder that was connected to a stable, stationary platform.
how long does it take to freeze water	· just now. Report Abuse. I usually fill a 16-ounce water bottle about 2/3 full and I lean it on some other items in the freezer so that the ice forms at an angle in the bottle. In about 2 or 3 hours, ice will have formed on the surface. I love to find it at that point and squeeze the bottle and drink the super-cold water with slivers of ice! Best Answer: It depends on the temperature of your freezer, of course. I'd say 3 - 4 hours but overnight's best! Now don't go opening the door every 20 minutes to check! .If you take two glasses, and fill one with a tiny bit of water, and the other about halfway, then put them both in the freezer, the one with less water will freeze first (you can try this at home, but I recommend using plastic cups and not glass ones). Report Abuse. The answer to your question really depends on three things: how much water you have, how cold it is to start out, and how cold the things around it are. Water actually freezes when it gets to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius), but the time it takes to get there may be different. Let's start with the first. If you take two glasses, and fill one with a tiny bit of water, and the other about halfway, then put them both in the freezer, the one with less water will freeze first (you can try this at home, but I recommend using plastic cups and not glass ones).

the receptors for taste are located in the	The receptors for taste are located in specialized organs called taste buds which are numerous on the surface of the epithelium covering the tongue in humans and mamals. The taste buds are also located on the papillae on the upper surface of the tongue and also on the roof of the oral cavity, the pharynx and larynx. - Olfactory receptors in the nose: chemoreceptors. - Taste receptors on the tongue: chemoreceptors. - Skin receptors: tactile, mechano, thermo, nociceptors. 2. Visceroreceptors: sensory receptors that produce sensations from organs or internal tissues. - Sensations include pain, hunger, thirst, fatigue or nausea.Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is the sensory impression of food or other substances on the tongue and is one of the five traditional senses. Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food or other substances. The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.

what is scantron	Scantron. A company name which is more commonly used for a type of multiple-choice test answer sheets. Teachers use Scantrons so they would not have to hand-grade their students' tests. Also, they are laid out such that test takers can cheat off others with very little effort. The reason for this is because Scantrons are divided into sections of about 10 entries each. The entries have fill-in bubbles which are wide and generously spaced apart. Therefore, cheaters can get several answers by taking one slight glimpse of another person's Scantron-at any angle. Tip: The best view is from the bottom. Another words, the Scantron of the person sitting in front of you(the answers show up very clear this way). When you get sight of it, count to yourself, 1,4,3,2,2,1,5,4,4,2,4,3,1, etc. teacher: you will be taking tomorrow's final on a scantron.How to Cheat on a Scantron Test. Three Methods: Messing With the Bubbles Messing With the Lines on the Form Cheating the Old Fashioned Way. Test scoring machines scan testing forms to mark incorrect answers wrong. If anything other than a right answer appears, that answer is marked wrong. Though somewhat uncommon, some Scantron forms have a space where you can mark that the form you're filling out is either a test or the answer key. If your teacher made an epic mistake of using one of these forms, exploit it and mark yours as the key.

how does amino acids help the body	It’s a practical and convenient way to make sure your body has the essential amino acids it needs in order to build proteins and regulate other bodily functions. BCAA’s (branched chain amino acids) for example are a type of essential amino acids. BCAA’s consist of leucine, isoleucine and valine. Leucine helps to increase blood, increase metabolism, and increase your bodys ability to rebuild and repair muscle tissue. Leucine can’t be absorbed by our bodies without the help of the other two amino acids isoleucine and valine. A combination of these three amino acids are absorbed directly into the muscle and converted to energy, which helps to prevent the break down ofThe essential amino acids are isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Another amino acid, histidine, is considered semi-essential because the body does not always require dietary sources of it. Report Abuse. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Twenty amino acids are needed to build the various proteins used in the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues. Eleven of these amino acids can be made by the body itself, while the other nine (called essential amino acids) must come from the diet. The classification of an amino acid as essential or nonessential does not reflect its importance, because all 20 amino acids are necessary for health
effect of sugar concentration on fermentation rate	Experimental design. The effects of sugar concentration (50% glucose + 50% fructose), temperature, and pH on yeasts growth were tested using a central composite circumscribed design with three repetitions in the centre to account for pure error. Other significant coefficients for yeast T73 were also the linear effect of temperature, and the linear and quadratic effects of sugar concentration (Table 3). The effect of the environmental variables on µ max of T73 can be studied by means of their respective coefficients.The graph shows that the higher the concentration of sugar the lower. the respiration rate. I believe this is because the more amount of. sugar added the more yeast die. This is due to either: 1. The high concentration of ethanol produced as a by-product. poisoning the yeast. 2. The temperature of the reaction being too high causing the yeast to. die or the enzymes to be denatured. 2. The temperature of the reaction, as some of the energy produced. converts into heat energy. At really high temperatures the reaction. will stop because the heat will have denatured the enzymes. 3. When there is a high sugar concentration the sugar molecules. diffuse into the yeast. But when the concentration of sugar is too low. the water in the yeast will diffuse out to equalise the concentration, creating a net of movement of water into an area where there is less. water

antidepressant drugs psychology definition	For detail of individual antidepressants see: List of antidepressants. An antidepressant, in the most common usage, is a medication taken to alleviate clinical depression or dysthymia ('milder' depression). Antidepressants are generally, if not in pharmacology, considered separately from stimulants. They are usually taken as a course over several weeks, months or years, and have a delayed onset of therapeutic action. Drugs used for an immediate euphoric effect only are not generally considered antidepressants. Despite the name, antidepressants are often used in the treatment of other conditions, including anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders and chronic pain. Some have also become known as lifestyle drugs, sometimes referred to as mood brightenersAntidepressant drugs may be prescribed as a first-line treatment for depression, or in conjunction with other methods of controlling depression, such as behavioral therapy and exercise. The main types of antidepressant drugs in use today are listed below, though the drugs available change frequently. Care should be used in combining these drugs with major or minor tranquilizers, or with anti-epileptic agents such as phenytoin (Dilantin) or carbamazepine (Tegretol). In 2003, one of the biggest concerns regarding new prescriptions for tricyclic antidepressants was data concerning overdoses from these drugs.

average salary for someone with a college degree	A: As of 2014, the average starting salary for someone with a finance degree is $57,300. This figure makes a finance degree the eighth most valuable college degree and the only one associated with high entry level pay rates not in a tech field. The amount earned from a finance career varies based on which type of position is pursued. For example, a financial analyst with a finance major is likely to earn an average salary of nearly $77,000, while a real estate appraiser with the same degree is likely to earn around $49,000. Accountants and auditors earn a median yearly salary of $63,500, while budget analysts earn $69,000. Finance majors who pursue careers as compensation, benefits and job analysis specialists, or cost estimators make salaries between $58,000 and $59,000 on averagePotential. Earning power with a bachelor's degree boosts your average salary significantly. In 2011, the BLS states that the average weekly income for a worker holding a bachelor's degree was $1,053. However, the median income of $45,000 trends slightly downward as of 2009. In 2009, this education group earned a median annual salary of $30,000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The trend for this educational group is downward when you adjust the median income to 2009 dollars. Related Reading: The Average Salary of a Director of Community Outreach at a University.
what is lactate important	The lactate test is primarily ordered to help determine if someone has lactic acidosis, a level of lactate that is high enough to disrupt a person's acid-base (ph) balance. A high lactate level in the blood means that the disease or condition a person has is causing lactate to accumulate. In general, a greater increase in lactate means a greater severity of the condition. When associated with lack of oxygen, an increase in lactate can indicate that organs are not functioning properly.Lactate is a great unknown in human metabolism despite its key role in regulating metabolism. For many years it has been thought that lactate was just a waste product as a result of anaerobic exercise or even a waste product of exercise that would crystalize resulting in muscle soreness. Nevertheless, lactate has been subject of study for many years and by important scientists including several Nobel Laureates. Lactate studies date back from the 19th century when a Nobel Laureate, Louis Pasteur in 1863 proposed that lactate was produced by lack of oxygen during muscle contraction. To conclude, lactate threshold remains as the most used training term worldwide and yet there is no consensus of what exactly it represents. There is too much confusion not just regarding what lactate threshold is but also what lactate per se is and what its role and importance in exercise and metabolism is.
why should a person accused of a crime be given the rights listed in the sixth amendment	If you are confused by what each line means, here are some good explanations to make the Sixth Amendment easier to understand: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial”: The person who is accused of a crime has the right to get a quick trial. This line does not mean that the person’s trial will be over in one week. Rather, this line means that the country or state cannot make the person sit in jail for a very long time, for example 5 years, while they for their trial. This would be very unfair to anyone who is not guilty. The Sixth Amendment was introduced as a part of the Bill of Rights into the United States Constitution on September 5, 1789 and was voted for by 9 out of 12 states on December 15, 1791. Understanding the Sixth Amendment Line by Line.Right to a Public Trial. The Sixth Amendment guarantees public trials in criminal cases. This is an important right, because the presence in courtrooms of a defendant's family and friends, ordinary citizens, and the press can help ensure that the government observes important rights associated with trials. Right to a Jury Trial. The Sixth Amendment gives a person accused of a crime the right to be tried by a jury, except for petty offenses carrying a sentence of six months or less of jail time. This right has traditionally been interpreted to mean a 12-person jury.
types of convenience food	Convenience foods can include products such as candy; beverages such as soft drinks, juices and milk; fast food; nuts, fruits and vegetables in fresh or preserved states; processed meats and cheeses; and canned products such as soups and pasta dishes. Convenience foods include ready-to-eat dry goods, frozen foods such as TV dinners, shelf-stable foods, prepared mixes such as cake mix, and snack foods. Bread, cheese, salted food and other prepared foods have been sold for thousands of years. Other kinds were developed with improvements in food technology. Types of convenience foods can vary by country and geographic region. Some convenience foods have received criticism due to concerns about nutritional content and how their packaging may increase solid waste in landfillConvenience foods are foods that require little preparation. With some convenience foods, you only have to heat them, and they are ready to eat in less than five minutes! The majority of convenience foods are processed foods. However, precut, prewashed, frozen, and canned fruits and vegetables also can be classified as convenience foods. Paul Goyette, http://bit.ly/GDgK62. On the other hand, processed convenience foods generally have a low nutritional quality compared to other foods. This is because of the sodium, fat, and/or added sugars they contain, along with low amounts of essential nutrients.
bananas how to keep fresh longer	We've discussed how wrapping bananas with plastic wrap keeps a bunch fresher longer, but if you want your banans to last as long as possible, the real key is to separate them and then wrap each individual stem with plastic wrap. Here's why. You can also slice them up and rest the cut sides in a little acid (lemon juice works best, maybe a little vinegar) to prevent browning. Some people also swear by putting them in the fridge to slow the process. If you're uncertain of the science here, it's really straightforward. Bananas, like many fruits, release ethylene gas naturally, which controls enzymatic browning and ripening of not just itself, but other fruits nearbTo keep a bunch of bananas fresh for longer, wrap the stems in some plastic wrap. Re-cover the bananas with the wrap after removing one. This method prevents ethylene gas, produced naturally in the ripening process, from reaching other parts of the fruit and prematurely ripening it. This technique is hit or miss, as the coverage from the plastic wrap is unlikely to fully prevent contact with the ethylene gas. Ethylene is actually used in the banana production facilities to induce ripening at just the right time to ensure that you buy a bunch of yellow (or greenish yellow) from your local grocer. (The next step is my preferred method, and the one that the science appears to back up with the most evidence.).
when does your cervix start to dilate during pregnancy	Effacement means that the cervix stretches and gets thinner. Dilatation means that the cervix opens. As labor nears, the cervix may begin to thin or stretch (efface) and open (dilate) to prepare for the passage of the baby through the birth canal (vagina). How fast the cervix thins and opens varies from woman to woman. In some women, the cervix may start to efface and dilate slowly over a period of weeks. A first-time mother often will not dilate until active labor begins. Late in your pregnancy, your health professional may manually check (wearing sterile gloves) how much your cervix has effaced and dilated. During labor, contractions in your uterus open (dilate) your cervix and help move the baby into position to be born.How Cervix Dilation is Measured. Dilation of the cervix is measured in centimeters. During labor, your cervix will stretch from 0cm to a fully dilated 10 cm. During a vaginal exam, cervix dilation is measured by how many finger widths fit into the opening of the cervix. If the tip of one finger fits, the cervix is 1 cm dilated. If 2 finger tips fit, that signifies 2 cm. I like to think of cervix dilation like opening the door to the womb to allow baby to come out. Normally, your cervix is closed and hard, protecting your uterus from the outside environment. In order for your baby to pass through, your cervix must dilate and thin out completely.
progressive era definition new nationalism	The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to 1920s. The main objective of the Progressive movement was eliminating corruption in government. The movement primarily targeted political machines and their bosses. By taking down these corrupt representatives in office a further means of direct democracy would be established. As part of this tradition of maternal activism, the Progressive-era General Federation supported a range of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care for mothers and children to a ban on child labor, each of which looked to the state to help implement their vision of social justice.Roosevelt made the case for what he called the New Nationalism in a speech in Osawatomie, Kansas, on August 31, 1910. The central issue he argued was government protection of human welfare and property rights, but he also argued that human welfare was more important than property rights. In the social sphere the platform called for. 1  A National Health Service to include all existing government medical agencies. 2  Social insurance, to provide for the elderly, the unemployed, and the disabled. 3  Limited injunctions in strikes. 4  A minimum wage law for women. 5  An eight hour workday. 6  A federal securities commission. 7  Farm relief. 8  Workers' ... 9  A
how to protect yourself from an emp	Below is a detailed write up about EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse) and how to protect yourself from it. EMP. The letters spell burnt out computers and other electrical systems and perhaps even a return to the dark ages if it were to mark the beginning of a nuclear war. But it doesn’t need to be that way. Once you understand EMP, you can take a few simple precautions to protect yourself and equipment from it. In fact, you can enjoy much of the “high tech” life style you’ve come accustomed to even after the use of a nuclear device has been used by terrorists–or there is an all-out WWIIIProtecting Yourself from EMP. (1) the equipment inside the box does NOT touch the metal container (plastic, wadded paper, or cardboard can all be used to insulate it from the metal) and (2) the metal shield is continuous without any gaps between pieces or extra-large holes in it. © 1989 by Duncan Long EMP. The letters spell burnt out computers and other electrical systems and perhaps even a return to the dark ages if it were to mark the beginning of a nuclear war. But it doesn't need to be that way. In such a case, the gamma radiation released during the flash cycle of the weapon would react with the upper layer of the earth's atmosphere and strip electrons free from the air molecules, producing electromagnetic radiation similar to broad-band radio waves (10 kHz-100 MHz) in the process.
why did the earthquake in ecuador happen	8.8M. N.B: The magnitude for this earthquake has been recalculated since the following articles were written. Magnitude 8.8 is a better determination of the size of this earthquake. A catastrophic magnitude 8.2 earthquake off the coast of Ecuador and Colombia generated a strong tsunami that killed 500 to 1500 there. It was observed all along the coast of Central America and as far north as San Francisco and west to Japan.....The wave arrived in Hilo at about 12.5 hours after the earthquake. From Lander and Lockridge, 1989, Tsunami in Hawaii A magnitude 8.2 earthquake off the coast of Ecuador produced a 5-m local tsunami that destroyed 49 houses and killed 500 people in Colombia. It was recorded at San Diego and San Francisco.. Share this page: 1  FacebookThe 1906 Ecuador–Colombia earthquake occurred at 15:36 UTC on January 31, off the coast of Ecuador, near Esmeraldas. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 8.8 and triggered a destructive tsunami that caused at least 500 casualties on the coast of Colombia. The earthquake occurred along the boundary between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. The earthquake is likely to be a result of thrust-faulting, caused by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate. The coastal parts of Ecuador and Colombia have a history of great megathrust earthquakes originating from this plate boundary
how long to keep fresh cooked chicken in the fridge	The amount of time you can leave food in the fridge depends on the food -- and the food's expiration date. Some foods can be left in the fridge a long time and still be safe to eat. Guidelines exist to help determine when you should keep food or throw it out to keep your risk for foodborne illness low. Leftovers. For dairy foods like milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheeses and butter, use the expiration date to determine how long they can safely be kept in your fridge. Many dairy products like milk safely last about two to three weeks. Cheeses and soy milk may last a few months.Cooked chicken could be good up to 4 days. Raw chicken is best used within 1 or 2 days. You should store the chicken in the coldest part of the refrigerator for best shelf life or put it in freezer if not used within that time frame. Thawed chicken should be cooked as soon as possible. If not using the chicken immediately, store in the refrigerator and use within 24 hours of thawing. Thaw frozen chicken using one of three methods: in the refrigerator; in a cold water bath, changing the water every 30 minutes; or in the microwave. If using one of the last two quick-thaw methods, cook the chicken immediately. Meats are kept better in the freezer. Meats can be kept in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days if raw and 1 to 2 days longer if cooked. Always place cooked meats in an airt … ight container.
why is bacteria important in the preparation of foods and beverages	The viruses are important to the food process in two respects: 1  As a bacteriophage of lactic or other fermentative bacteria. 2  Bacteriophage infections of starter cultures can interfere seriously with the manufacture of cheese, buttermilk, sauerkraut, pickles, wine, beer, and other desirable fermentative products. Fermented and pickled foods owe their stability to the microbial development of organic acids by lactic bacteria or the addition of such acids to the foods, especially in the presence of a relatively high level of salt.Bacteria are not only used for fermentaion in the dairy industry, but for use in other such food production as in the processing of coffee and cocoa, the manufacturing of food additives, and other such processes such as the making of xanthan gum and vinegar. Bacteria, and most viruses do not tolerate acids. This is the reason that vinegar retards the growth of most bacteria. The following is a list of other foods where bacteria and other microbes are necessary for the making of certain foodstuffs. Vitamins are the most important non-prescription medications. Dehydration, Microbes, and Spoilage. Bacteria and Food. Microbes and food have always had a love-hate relationship. Food producers have learned to harness their power -- and sometimes for good use. The most common usage for bacteria in food preparation is with dairy fermentations.
typical payout for whiplash injury	Tweet on Twitter. The average payout for whiplash claims is a difficult figure to arrive at because whiplash can affect people very differently, with results ranging from minor pain in the shoulder to paraplegia. It is possible, however, to look at the average for different kinds of whiplash injury. At Accident Advice Helpline we advise that you always claim for whiplash even if your injuries are minor because sometimes such injuries can develop into something worse a few months or years later. If you suffer whiplash that leaves you with soft tissue damage and ongoing pain in your shoulder or neck but your doctor thinks it will heal after a few months, you may still be entitled to compensation in the range of £1,000 to £5,500.There is not a set amount for a whiplash claim. The amount of compensation you will receive depends on the severity of your injuries. Typically, $1,280 to $4,140 is paid for minor whiplash where recovery takes place within one year of the accident. And for severe, serious injury where recurring pain and possibility of surgery may occur, this can be from $13,000 to $24,000. The average payout for pain and suffering from a car accident is  based on the type of injury and the duration of pain associated  with the injury. Payouts also take into co … nsideration the amount of  time a person has been kept from their normal duties, such as a  job.
what yr sanders elected senator	In Vermont, voters have elected Bernie Sanders to become the country’s first self-described socialist to be elected to the U.S. Senate. Running as an independent, Sanders won 65 percent of the vote, easily beating his Republican opponent Rich Tarrant who is one Vermont’s wealthiest residents. Sanders will replace fellow independent Jim Jeffords in the Senate. For the past 16 years, Sanders has served as Vermont’s sole member in the House. On Tuesday, voters in Vermont also elected Democrat Peter Welch to fill Sanders’ seat in Congress. This past week I talked with Bernie Sanders in Vermont. I asked him what it meant to be the first socialist senator.Sanders became senator after Jim Jeffords retired from the senate in 2006. In 2012, he was re-elected by a landslide. In August 2011, Public Policy Polling found that 67% of people supported Sanders. Sanders is the longest-serving independent in United States history. Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. He thinks that a social democratic government for the United States is a good idea. In January 2015, Sanders became a member of the Senate Budget Committee. Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981. He was re-elected three times. In 1991, he became a United States representative for Vermont's At-large congressional district. He was a congressman for 16 years. In 2006, he was elected to the U.S. Senate
what is tencel lyocell	Lyocell is the generic name for a biodegradable fabric that's made out of treated wood pulp. It's commonly sold under the brand name Tencel®, which is made by Lenzing AG. Known for its versatility, durability, and strength when both wet and dry, this material is used in everything from clothing to cars. The production process for lyocell begins by treating wood chips approximately the size of a coin until they form a substance similar to a thick paper, which is then sent to a fabric production factory. Once there, it is broken down into about 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares and chemically dissolvedNMMO monohydrate is used as a solvent in the Lyocell process to produce Tencel fiber. 1  Lyocell is considered an eco friendly biodegradable fabric ‘ composed of cellulose precipitated from an organic solution in which no substitution of the hydroxyl groups takes place and no chemical intermediates are formed (Source). Tencel Fabric (Lyocell) from nature to your closet. Tencel fabric is an amazing eco friendly fabric that represents a milestone in the development of environmentally sustainable textiles. Tencel is a natural, man made fibre which is also referred to as Lyocell. Made with wood pulp from sustainable tree farms, tencel textiles are created though the use of nanotechnology in an award-winning closed-loop process that recovers or decomposes all solvents and emissions
difference between net salary and ctc	Cost to company (CTC) is the total cost that an employee is incurring in a company. Gross Salary is the one which you see every month. But this is before any deduction.Net Salary is what an employee get to his/her hand after deductions.(this is the take home salary). Many Of Us having confusion regarding Salary, Net Salary, Gross, Cost to Company they are same or different. I Hope this may help you in clearing you doubts. I shall try to cover what makes the salary? What is the difference between Salary, Net Salary, Gross Salary, Cost to Company.Summary: 1. Cost to Company is the amount that an employer will spend on an employee in a particular year, whereas, gross salary is the amount an employee receives as a salary, before any deductions. 2. A gross salary will not include the contributions to the PF and gratuity, among other things. CTC vs Gross Salary. A salary is the periodic payment that an employee receives from an employer in return for the work he provides. An employee, when seeking employment, will always look towards CTC, or Cost to Company, and gross salary. The difference between CTC and gross salary, is that some components are included in one, but not in the other. Cost to Company is the amount that an employer will spend on an employee in a particular year, whereas, gross salary is the amount an employee receives as a salary, before any deduction
eschooltoday fossil fuels	Waste incinerators, manufacturing industries and power plants emit high levels of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air. This happens almost everywhere that people live. Petroleum refineries also release lots of hydrocarbons into the air. Human activities that result in air pollution include: 1. Emissions from industries and manufacturing activities Consider a typical manufacturing plant: You will notice that there are long tubes (called chimneys) erected high into the air, with lots of smoke and fumes coming out of it.Energy exists freely in nature. Some of them exist infinitely (never run out, called RENEWABLE), the rest have finite amounts (they took millions of years to form, and will run out one day, called NON-RENEWABLE). Non-renewable energy is energy from fossil fuels (coal, crude oil, natural gas) and uranium. Fossil fuels are mainly made up of Carbon. It is believed that fossil fuels were formed over 300 million years ago, when the earth was a lot different in its landscape. It had swampy forests and very shallow seas. Air, water and land pollution are all consequences of using fossil fuels. In the pages that follow, we shall take a look at what each source of non-renewable energy is made of, and how they are used. Note that not all non-renewable energy comes from fossil fuels. There is also uranium, which is not a fossil fuel.
how long should you do a master cleanse	Normally, 2-3 bowel movements a day are common on this cleanse. Will I feel hunger pains during the diet? As long as you consume the lemonade mixture in regular intervals (atleast 6 cups and up to 12 per day) you should not feel any hunger pains. Natural gum has been used to help suppress cravings, and organic green/mint teas for a special treat. How many days should I do the Master Cleanse? It is recommended to cleanse for a period of atleast 10 days to acheive the maximum results/benefits that this cleanse has to offer. Some have cleansed for a period of up to 40 days, but this should not be done without extensive knowledge, experience, and consent from your health care professionalThe Lemon Cleanse, also known as the Master Cleanse, is typically done for a period of 10 days to one month. You can decide on your own how long you wish to do a Lemon Cleanse, or you can use your tongue as an indicator of whether you are fully detoxified. If you have a whitish coating on your tongue, this indicates that you have candida in your system. Frequency. The amount of time you do your Lemon Cleanse will influence how long you should wait before you do it again. You can do a Lemon Cleanse every three to six months. If you only cleanse for 10 days, you can do it again in three months. If you extend it out for an entire month, you should wait six months before you do it again
what is exudative senile macular degeneration	(Redirected from Senile macular degeneration). Macular degeneration, often age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), is a medical condition that usually affects older adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It occurs in dry and wet forms. Although some macular dystrophies affecting younger individuals are sometimes rarely referred to as macular degeneration, the term generally refers to age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD). The retina is a network of visual receptors and nerves.In the wet, or exudative, form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pathologic choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) develop under the retina. The CNVM can leak fluid and blood and, if left untreated, ultimately cause a centrally blinding disciform scar. Approximately 10-20% of patients with nonexudative AMD eventually progress to the exudative form, which is responsible for the majority of the estimated 1.75 million cases of advanced AMD in the United States. See the image below. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), exudative. Physicians have traditionally recognized two types of macular degeneration: dry and wet. The hallmark of the dry, or nonexudative form, is the deposition of extracellular material beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that leads to the formation of drusen
how much space do i need for system image	Does the image actually require the amount of space that is being used on the hard drive you are trying to backup? For example, I have 104GB used up on my computer right now. do i need 104GB to create a system image for backup? thanks in advance! Report Abuse. Yes, you will need to have as much space available for the image as you have on the hard drive you are making the image of. This is because an image is essentially an exact replica or copy of your hard drive. If you need an image of a 500 GB HD, the image is going to be 500 GB as well, since it's a complete copy.How to Create and Restore System Images. To create a system image on Windows. You can then restore these backup images using the Advanced Startup Options on Windows 8 or the System Recovery option on Windows 7. These can be accessed from a Windows installation disc or recovery drive. On a Mac, you can use Time Machine create and restore system image backups. You then have a complete system image you can copy back onto a drive to restore the system state. The system image contains a complete snapshot of everything on the computer’s hard drive at any given time. So, if you have 500 GB of space used on a 1 TB drive, the system image will be about 500 GB. Some system image programs use compression to shrink the system image’s size by as much as possible, but don’t count on saving much space in this way

What are the carotenoids that can be converted in the body to vitamin A called	Carotenoids are organic pigments that are found in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants and some other photosynthetic organisms, including some bacteria and some fungi. Carotenoids can be produced from fats and other basic organic metabolic building blocks by all these organisms. Carotenoids that contain unsubstituted beta-ionone rings (including beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin and gamma-carotene) have vitamin A activity (meaning that they can be converted to retinal), and these and other carotenoids can also act as antioxidants.Carotenoids are natural fat-soluble pigments found in certain plants. Carotenoids provide the bright red, orange, or yellow coloration of many vegetables, serve as antioxidants, and can be a source for vitamin A activity. There are more than 600 known natural carotenoids, all of them synthesized only in plants. About 10% of dietary carotenoids are converted to vitamin A in the body and contribute 25% of our total vitamin A. Of the 600 carotenoids that have been identified, about 30 to 50 are believed to have vitamin A activity. Carotenoids the body converts to vitamin A are referred to as provitamin A carotenoids. The most well known of this group are beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. Many carotenoids are antioxidants that protect cells against free radicals by neutralizing them before they cause oxidative damage
determining a unit holder cost base	Imagine that you invested $10,000 in ABC Inc., which gave you 1,000 shares in the company. The cost basis of the investment is $10,000, but it is more often expressed in terms of a per share basis, so for this investment it would be $10 ($10,000/1,000). After a year has passed, the value of the investment has risen to $15 per share, and you decide to sell. By Chad Langager AAA |. A: The cost basis of any investment is the original value of an asset adjusted for stock splits, dividends and capital distributions. It is used to calculate the capital gain or loss on an investment for tax purposes.Breakeven Analysis. When you calculate the unit costs of production, you are calculating the breakeven point, or minimum price, you must sell each unit at to make a profit. For example, say you produce 2,000 units costing $3 per unit that you resell at $5 per unit. Your profit is $5 minus $3, or $2 a unit. Calculate Unit Costs. You can calculate the unit costs of production by dividing the total amount of your fixed and variable costs by the total number of units you produced. For example, say your total fixed costs are $30,000, your variable costs are $50,000 and you produced 40,000 units. The total production costs are the $30,000 fixed costs added to the $50,000 variable costs for a total of $80,000. Divide 40,000 units by $80,000 to get your $2 per unit production costs

what is pragmatic knowledge	Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870. Pragmatism rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality. Instead, pragmatists consider thought an instrument or tool for prediction, problem solving and action. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes. One application of pragmatism that is being developed, is the one between pragmatism and urbanism / urban transformation. A pragmatic approach to urban transformation values and evaluates the consequences of a design, rather than only considering the initial intentions.Knowledge of aspects of language can be categorized into three levels: linguistic, metalinguistic, and metalinguistic verbalization (Otto, 1982). Children first develop knowledge of language at a linguistic level, or usage level. This is the “know-how”: being able to use language in communicative contexts. The linguistic level of syntactic knowledge is evident as children are able to express their ideas in a form that is grammatically appropriate to their dialect or language. Morphemic knowledge at the linguistic level is evident when a child can use appropriate plural forms of nouns or use prefixes and suffixes.

Both in Canada in the United States the basic requirements to become a doctor include a Bachelor’s degree, although, rarely, some students enter from 2nd or 3d year. Assume you will need 4 years before getting into medical school. Before you apply for medical school, you must write the MCAT exam that tests your knowledge across a broad spectrum of categories. This is why it is important for you to round out your science classes with social sciences as well. After 4 years of medical school, you will write an exam to obtain your MD. Then, an additional 3 to 7 years picking a specialty such as family medicine, psychiatry, dermatology, etc. Whew! After all of that time, you will write an exam and obtain your certificate in the area of your choice.
symptoms of muscle disorders	A Muscle Disease is defined by some typical set of symptoms that are found across most types of muscular diseases. These include progressive weakness of the muscles, pain in the limbs, undue lethargy or exhaustion, cramping or stiffness of certain muscle groups, stiff joints and uncoordinated body movements. 1 Typical symptoms of DM include muscular weakness among the thighs, hips, upper arms, back and shoulders. 2  Polymyositis (PM). 3  Polymyositis is a muscle disease that causes widespread inflammation of muscles and usually occurs after the age of 20 years.Muscle symptoms can also accompany serious conditions that can even be life threatening, such as severe dehydration, spinal cord injury, or stroke. Muscle symptoms can be a sign of a serious disease, disorder or condition, such as muscular dystrophy, an infection of the muscles, or a pinched nerve. Seek prompt medical attention if your muscle symptoms are persistent or causing you concern. I was in excruciating pain…and you rescued me. Any type of muscle can produce symptoms when affected by various diseases, disorders and conditions. These include infection, trauma, autoimmune diseases, neurological and muscular disorders, malignancy (cancer), and even some medications. Muscle symptoms can also involve the ligaments, tendons and fascia, which is the soft tissue that connects the muscles, bones and organs
type a positive blood type food list	The antigens present in blood determine the blood type of a person. Antigens, A and B are present on the blood cell's surface and works as markers in the body. People with blood type o positive have an Rh antigen as well as A and B antigens present in the plasma. Type O is the most common blood type and is often sought out for blood donation as well because type O blood can be donated to people of any blood types without fear of rejection. Vegetables. The vegetables that are beneficial for people with type O blood are spinach, broccoli, kale, romaine lettuce and collard greens as they are rich in vitamin K. Vegetables like leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes, pumpkins and parsley can also be included with an o positive blood type diet.Blood Type A Menu. On the blood type diet, a good breakfast if you're type A is whole-grain cereal, such as steel-cut oatmeal, along with fresh mixed fruit. Typical snacks for type A are foods such as fruit, nuts, seeds, rice cakes and peanut butter. For lunch, it's typical to have a large, hearty salad with lots of fresh vegetables. The Blood Type Diet Premise. D’Adamo theorizes that your blood type provides a distinctive marker for which foods are best for you, based on the diet of your ancestors with the same blood type. This means a nutritious diet for one blood type may include different foods than a nutritious diet for another
how long after do you ovulate after your period	There is not a way to know for certain how long after your period you will ovulate, however. Ovulation does not occur in relation to the previous period, but rather to the next period. You will ovulate 14 days prior to the start of your next menstrual cycle. This means, then, that if you have a 28-day cycle, you will ovulate roughly 14 days after your period, and 14 days prior to the start of your next period. If you have a 31 day cycle, however, you will ovulate roughly 17 days after your period, and, again, 14 days prior to the start of your next period. If you are trying to conceive, you should begin to have intercourse roughly 4-5 days prior to ovulation, as the sperm can live in the body for about 5 days. It's not likely, but it is possible. Your chances of getting pregnant just after your period depend on how short your menstrual cycle is, and how long your period lasts. One of your ovaries will release an egg (ovulation) about 12 to 14 days before your period starts. The first day of your period, when you start bleeding, is counted as the first day of your cycle. If you have a 28-day cycle, you'll usually ovulate some time between day 12 and day 16 of your cycle. If your cycle is short, 22 days for example, then you could ovulate just days after your period, if your period lasted seven days. The longest that sperm can survive in fertile cervical mucus is
what is the main tendon in the upper leg called	The knee is a pivot-like hinge joint in the leg that connects the bones in the upper and lower leg. It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is where the femur in the upper leg meets with the tibia and fibula bones in the lower leg. Another bone, the patella or kneecap, is at the center of the knee. The knee joint is composed of numerous tendons, ligaments, and protective elements, such as cartilage and bursa. Many muscles that power foot movements begin as high up as the back of the knee and extend down to the foot. Possibly the most important structure in the lower leg is the Achilles tendon. It connects three muscles—the plantaris, calf, and soleus—to the heel bone.The quadriceps muscle group consists of four muscles: the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the vastus intermedius, and the vastus medialis. These muscles form a large, fleshy mass that covers the front and sides of the femur (upper leg bone). They are the primary extensor of the knee. The quadriceps muscle group consists of four muscles: the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the vastus intermedius, and the vastus medialis. It is a large fleshy mass that covers the front and sides of the femur bone (upper leg bone). The muscles work together as the primary extensor of the knee. The rectus femoris is the only two-joint muscle in the group, crossing both the knee and the hip joint
what chemicals can be made from salt	It can be made in a laboratory by the reaction of sodium with chlorine. However, it is found naturally in large amounts in sea water or in underground deposits. It is often obtained either by evaporating sea water or by mining underground deposits. Mining. Salt can be mined as rock salt which is used to treat icy roads in the winter. It lowers the melting point of the ice on the roads so that it melts, even when the temperature is below 0ºC. Salt can also be mined by solution mining. This happens in Cheshire in the North West of England. Water is pumped underground and into the salt deposit. Salt dissolves in the water, forming a concentrated salt solution. This is then pumped up to the surface ready for use by the chemical industry. Solution mining is a continuous process that is safer than sending miners underground. Mining for salt can lead to subsidenceCommon salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. The manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries. A major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.5%. This means that there are about 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts, predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions, per kilogram (2.2 lbs) of water.
what molecule inhibits phosphofructokinase?	For example, ATP allosterically inhibits phosphofructokinase, but it activates the functionally opposite enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (see slide 7.5.3). Similarly, phosphorylation inhibits glycogen synthase but activates glycogen phosphorylase, which degrades glycogen (slide 8.4.1). Allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase by AMP. To accomplish the stimulation of phosphofructokinase, AMP interacts with the enzyme at an allosteric binding site, that is, a site that is distant and functionally distinct from the active site.PFK-1 catalyzes the important committed step of glycolysis, the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate and ATP to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP. Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration, both anaerobic and aerobic. Because phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose-6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP, it is one of the key regulatory and rate limiting steps of glycolysis. PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition, and in this way, the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cell’s energy requirements. For example, a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis.

listeria monocytogenes bacteria characteristics	The Bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a rod shaped, gram positive bacterial pathogen that infects its hosts through food. It moves by way of flagella. The name came from Joseph Lister, the same person who suggested that doctors should sterilize surgical instruments prior to surgery. The bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, cause a disease in humans that is an important public health issue. The disease is called Listeriosis. Listeriosis is one of the leading causes of death among food borne pathogens. This disease affects newborn babies, pregnant women, and adults with a weakened immune system mainly. The disease Listeria monocytogenes causes is said to affect humans in two different ways, invasive and non-invasive. The non-invasive form of listeriosis brings about certain symptoms such as diarrhea, muscle pain, fever, and headaches. However, the invasive form of listeriosis is much more serious.Well these symptoms are definitely a sign of food poisoning and more specifically the serious infection, listeriosis, caused by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes has many fascinating properties. It is a non spore-forming, Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium. It is a microaerophilic, facultative anaerobe and intercellular pathogen.(2) It is capable of growing at temperatures as low as 3°C, which makes it very easy to replicate despite refrigeration.(3).
what is a HGB test	HGB test or Hemoglobin test is a test to determine the levels of hemoglobin circulating in the blood. Hemoglobin is contained in the red blood cells and is important in the transport of oxygen from the lungs to the various tissues of the body. It also helps in maintaining the proper structure and shape of red blood cells. If hemoglobin levels are not normal, it may indicate certain illnesses. Usually hemoglobin tests are part of CBC or complete blood count. This is a generic blood test known to many and this involves measurement of certain blood components like, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, hematocrit, and hemoglobin. Hemoglobin tests are done to know if a person has anemia or polycythemia. These conditions involve abnormal measurements of hemoglobin in the blood. When a person has anemia, the function of the red blood cells will be hampered leading to various complications.Hemoglobin is made of heme, an iron compound, and globin, a protein. The iron gives blood its red color. Hemoglobin tests make use of this red color. A chemical is added to a sample of blood to make the red blood cells burst. Abnormal results. A low hemoglobin usually indicates the person has anemia. Further tests are done to discover the cause and type of anemia. Dangerously low hemoglobin levels put a person at risk of a heart attack, congestive heart failure, or stroke.
what causes movement in hip replacement apparatus	The decision whether to have hip replacement surgery should be a cooperative one between you, your family, your primary care doctor, and your orthopaedic surgeon. The process of making this decision typically begins with a referral by your doctor to an orthopaedic surgeon for an initial evaluation. Recommendations for surgery are based on the extent of your pain, disability and general health status, not solely on age. You may benefit from hip replacement surgery if: 1  Hip pain limits your everyday activities such as walking or bending. 2  Hip pain continues while resting, either day or night. 3  Stiffness in a hip limits your ability to move or lift your leg. 4  You have little pain relief from anti-inflammatory drugs or glucosamine sulfateHip replacement, also called total hip arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure to replace a worn out or damaged hip with a prosthesis (an artificial joint). This surgery may be considered following a hip fracture (breaking of the bone) or for someone who has severe pain due to arthritis. Reasons for the procedure. Hip replacement surgery is a treatment for pain and disability in the hip. The most common condition that results in the need for hip replacement surgery is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the loss of joint cartilage in the hip. Damage to the cartilage and bones limits movement and may cause pain
accounting cost of labour	The cost of labor is the salaries and wages paid to employees, plus related payroll taxes and benefits. The term may also relate to a specific time period or a job (if the employer is using a job costing system to track costs). The cost of labor may be subdivided into the cost of labor related to the production of goods (known as the cost of direct labor) and the cost of labor related to all other activities (known as the cost of indirect labor). It may be necessary to include a large number of benefits in the calculation of the cost of labor. For example, if an employee is paid $1,000 in an accounting period, here is a sample of what the total cost might be:Thus, the typical cost of labor includes a premium of usually 20% to 35% for additional tax and benefit payments, of which medical insurance is usually the largest component. It is useful to understand the cost of labor for a number of reasons, including: 1  Cost management. The cost of labor may be subdivided into the cost of labor related to the production of goods (known as the cost of direct labor) and the cost of labor related to all other activities (known as the cost of indirect labor). It may be necessary to include a large number of benefits in the calculation of the cost of labor. For example, if an employee is paid $1,000 in an accounting period, here is a sample of what the total cost might be:
what is the insula	Adorable animal families that will make you aww. The insula is another name given to the area of the brain known as the insular cortex, the tissue surrounding the largest portion of the brain. Other names for this structure include insular lobe or insulary cortex. The insula is part of the cerebral cortex and helps to regulate emotion and works to assist in motor control function. The insula has been clinically divided into two separate sections, anterior and posterior. Each of these sections is responsible for a diverse number of functions within the human body. Body functions known as interoceptive awareness is regulated by the insula. Some of these functions include the timing of a person's heartbeat as well as blood pressure control. The perception of pain is controlled to a limited degree by the insula, as is the feeling of having a full bladder.The insular cortex is divided into two parts: the larger anterior insula and the smaller posterior insula in which more than a dozen field areas have been identified. The cortical area overlying the insula toward the lateral surface of the brain is the operculum (meaning lid). The insular cortex is considered a separate lobe of the telencephalon by some authorities. Other sources see the insula as a part of the temporal lobe. It is also sometimes grouped with limbic structures deep in the brain into a limbic lobe.
when were the franks around	When the Franks first appeared as such in the 3rd century, they spoke the same language, Proto-Germanic. This has been reconstructed from Germanic reflex languages, chance personal and place names in documents, words from languages such as Latin and inscriptions in a native script called the Elder Futhark. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as Imperator Romanorum by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. In this way, Romance speakers came to be seen as Franks in some contexts.Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks The Conversion of Clovis From The Chronicle of St. Denis, I.18-19, 23: Forum Weekly Poll Please Help Click Here The Franks Date 2001 A History of the Franks. Franks. Clovis. Christianity and the FranksThe Franks were a group of Germanic tribes that, about the middle of the 3rd century AD, dwelt along the middle and lower Rhine River. The Franks appeared in the Roman provinces around 253 and soon thereafter established themselves in two principal groups, the Salian and the Ripuarian. In 496 the Alemannians, a Germanic confederation like the Franks, who also had been, for some time past, assailing the Roman Empire on the banks of the Rhine or the frontiers of Switzerland, crossed the river and invaded the settlements of the Franks on the left bank.
does the lymphatic system maintain blood pressure	The lymphatic system plays a vital role in the proper functioning of the body. One of the major roles of this organ system is to drain excess fluid surrounding tissues and organs and return it to the blood. Returning lymph to the blood helps to maintain normal blood volume and pressure. It also prevents edema, the excess accumulation of fluid around tissues. 1 The spleen is the largest organ of the lymphatic system. 2  Its primary function is to filter blood of damaged cells, cellular debris, and pathogens. 3  Like the thymus, the spleen houses and aids in the maturation of lymphocytes. 4  Lymphocytes destroy pathogens and dead cells inThis fluid becomes the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. Lymph vessels collect and filter this fluid before directing it toward blood vessels near the heart. It is here that lymph re-enters blood circulation. Returning lymph to the blood helps to maintain normal blood volume and pressure. It also prevents edema, the excess accumulation of fluid around tissues. Large lymphatic vessels are composed of three layers. Once the fluid enters the lymph capillaries, it is called lymph. Lymph capillaries can be found in most areas of the body with the exceptions of the central nervous system, bone marrow, and non-vascular tissue. Lymphatic capillaries join to form lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels transport lymph to lymph nodes.

what does sodibic do	Sodium bicarbonate reduces stomach acid. It is used as an antacid to treat heartburn, indigestion, and upset stomach. Sodium bicarbonate is a very quick-acting antacid. It should be used only for temporary relief. If you need to treat long-term stomach acid problems (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, GERD), talk with your doctor about other medications. Sodium bicarbonate is the active ingredient in baking soda. Because this medication contains salt (sodium), do not use if you are on a salt-restricted diet. During pregnancy, this medication should be used only when clearly needed. This medication may worsen high blood pressure during pregnancy (toxemia of pregnancy). Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.uric acid calculus a hard, yellow or reddish-yellow urinary calculus formed from uric acid. urinary calculus a calculus in any part of the urinary tract; it is vesical when lodged in the bladder and renal (see kidney stone) when in the renal pelvis. Common types named for their primary components are oxalate calculi, phosphate calculi, and uric acid calculi. phosphate calculus a urinary calculus composed of a phosphate along with calcium oxalate and ammonium urate; it may be hard, soft, or friable, and so large that it may fill the renal pelvis and calices. prostatic calculus a concretion formed in the prostate, chiefly of calcium carbonate and phosphate.
what is a parallel circuit used for	In a series circuit, the current through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component. Consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and one 6 V battery. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. A circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a series circuit; likewise, one connected completely in parallel is known as a parallel circuit.power lines image by Edsweb from Fotolia.com. A parallel circuit is an electrical circuit which has two or more paths for an electrical charge to flow through. The parallel circuit is the standard electrical circuit found in most homes and devices. Because it provides more than one way for a current to flow through to a device, it creates a much more stable and efficient power system than would otherwise be possible. The uses of the parallel circuit are manifold. Parallel circuits are used inside many electrical devices and appliances. The main reason parallel circuitry is used in this context is to take advantage of more than one power source, like when more than one battery is being used in a portable device.
what is a misanthropist	Misanthropy is the general hatred, distrust or disdain of the human species or human nature. A misanthrope or misanthropist is someone who holds such views or feelings. The word's origin is from the Greek words μῖσος (misos, hatred) and ἄνθρωπος (anthrōpos, man, human). The condition is often confused with asociality. Martin Heidegger had also been said to show misanthropy in his concern of the they—the tendency of people to conform to one view, which no one has really thought through, but is just followed because, they say so. This might be thought of as more of a criticism of conformity rather than people in general.I Am a Misanthrope. Misanthropy is a personality trait characterized by a general dislike, distrust, or hatred of the human species or a disposition to dislike and/or distrust other people's silent consensus about reality. The word comes from the Greek words μίσος (misos, hatred) and άνθρωπος (anthrōpos, man, human being). A misanthrope is a person who dislikes or distrusts humanity as a general rule.. Unlike what some misanthropes here have said, misanthropes do not have to hate every single person!! Misanthropy can often be characterized as disillusionment with what is perceived to be Man or human nature. The misanthrope, having grown to expect Man to assume a romantic and simplistic ideal, is consistently confronted with conflicting evidence.
what is a fire opal	About Fire Opal-History and Introduction. Fire opal is a gem-quality form of amorphous hydrated silicon dioxide with no crystalline structure. Like other opal gemstones, between three and ten percent (and in some cases as much as 21 percent) of the weight of fire opal is water. Unlike most opal, fire opal occurs with good transparency and because of this, it is usually faceted rather than cut en cabochon. On the other hand, brownish fire opal is usually cut en cabochon to enhance and maximize its desirable play of color effect.The gemstone fire opal is a rare type of opal that can be found mainly in Mexico. There are two different varieties of fire opal. The first type of fire opal is a red, orange or yellow and has translucent features and a minimal amount of color play. The second type of fire opal is a brownish color and has similar play or color as the precious opal. The color range of the fire opal gemstone can be anywhere from a reddish brown, to an orange yellowish shade. The most favored fire opal stones are those with a burnt autumn red-orange color. Fire Opal Gemstones. Maintaining that deep reddish-orange color, the Fire Opal also has high transparency and a color play that makes it the most valuable and rarest in the world among Opals. With such an eye widening radiance, the Fire Opal and its warm glow makes it a favorite amongst jewel enthusiast.
what is normal cholesterol levels for a woman	Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels. Blood cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). A deciliter is one-tenth of a liter). NCEP defines a desirable total cholesterol level as less than 200 mg/dL, and levels for most women stay in the healthy or desirable range until middle-age. But between the ages of 45 and 55, women's average total cholesterol rises to almost 220 mg/dL. Between the ages of 55 and 64, those levels average 240 mg/dL. The body is able to meet all these needs by producing cholesterol in the liver. High blood cholesterol is a major women's health issue. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in every six adults—or 16.3 percent of the population—has high cholesterol, defined as 240 mg/dL or higher.It is important to be aware of your cholesterol levels because a high cholesterol level double your risk for developing cardiovascular disease. The recommended level of cholesterol differs slightly for men and women and knowing your numbers is the first step in keeping your cholesterol at a healthy level. There are two different types of lipoproteins: low density lipoproteins, or LDL, and high density lipoproteins, or HDL. LDL cholesterol is considered bad cholesterol.. Having high levels in your body can cause LDL cholesterol to build up in the body's arteries, increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease.

dose of amitriptyline for neuropathic pain	Antidepressants. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are the “gold standard” for neuropathic pain as they are the most effective and best-known drugs for this condition. They can also be useful for chronic nociceptive pain, especially if there is a neuropathic component to it. Drug therapy. Conventional painkillers such as codeine and ibuprofen are used for nociceptive pain. They are often not effective for neuropathic pain. Most of the drugs used for the relief of neuropathic pain were originally developed to treat different conditions. For instance, amitriptyline is an antidepressant drug but is now probably used more commonly for pain than for its original useThe typical starting dose of any TCA for the treatment of neuropathic pain is 10 to 25 mg nightly. This can be increased by 10 to 25 mg every 3 to 7 days as tolerated up to a usual maximum of 150 mg nightly. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) inhibit presynaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and block cholinergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, and sodium channels. Several TCAs, including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine, have been studied for the treatment of neuropathic pain. This class of medications has shown positive results in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), painful polyneuropathy, and postmastectomy pain
process costing - weighted average	The main difference between weighted average cost accounting, LIFO, and FIFO methods of accounting is the difference in which each method calculates inventory and cost of goods sold.The weighted average cost method uses the average of the costs of the goods to assign costs.In other words, weighted average uses the formula: Total cost of items in inventory available for sale divided by total number of units available for sale.In contrast, FIFO (first in, first out) accounting means that the costs assigned to goods are the costs for the first goods bought.n other words, weighted average uses the formula: Total cost of items in inventory available for sale divided by total number of units available for sale. In contrast, FIFO (first in, first out) accounting means that the costs assigned to goods are the costs for the first goods bought.Process Costing – Weighted Average Method. Process costing system is used for standardized production processes. Whenever a process cost sheet is prepared for a department, the department most likely has some unfinished units either in its beginning work in process, closing work in process or both.nlike FIFO method, which assumes costs introduced first into a department are transferred out first, weighted average method does not assume any specific order. Process costing under weighted-average method involves the following steps:
who is a carrier of food poisoning	Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Food poisoning occurs when food or water contaminated with germs (microbes), poisons (toxins) or chemicals is eaten or drunk. Microbes include bacteria, viruses and parasites. Parasites are living things (organisms) that live within, or on, another organism. Typically, food poisoning causes an infection of the gut (intestines), called gastroenteritis. This infection leads to to diarrhoea and being sick (vomiting). There are over 2,500 different strains (subtypes) of salmonella. One type of salmonella, Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), can cause typhoid fever. Adults. If you have gastroenteritis from any cause (including possible food poisoning caused by salmonella), you should seek medical advice in any of the following cases (or if there are any other symptoms that you are concerned about): 1  If you suspect that you are becoming dehydrated.Foodborne disease can also be caused by a large variety of toxins that affect the environment. Foodborne illness can also be caused by pesticides or medicines in food and naturally toxic substances such as poisonous mushrooms or reef fish. Viral infections make up perhaps one third of cases of food poisoning in developed countries. In the US, more than 50% of cases are viral and noroviruses are the most common foodborne illness, causing 57% of outbreaks in 2004.
what does a bruised spleen feel like	Bruised spleen symptoms are not very clear, resulting in late diagnosis of the condition. Noticeable ones include abdominal pain, soreness in the abdomen, localized back pain, and low blood pressure amongst others. Advertisement. The spleen is a crucial organ of the immune system, responsible for preventing infections. It is located on the upper left side of the body, below the diaphragm (in the 9-12 ribs). Its susceptibility to injury is partly because of its position in the abdomen. Damage or injury to this organ is a cause of medical concern, considering its role in the proper functioning of the body.. The prime reason for a bruised spleen is physical injury or a direct blow to the area. Also, it is prone to damage when it is in the enlarged state, particularly during the episode of an infection.A bruised spleen (or spleen contusion) is bruising to the spleen which occurs after a direct impact to the upper left abdomen. It may occur after a fall or a car accident. It is not as severe an injury as a spleen laceration (or rupture). 1 Instant pain on impact. 2  Pain is located in the left side of the abdomen. 3  Pain may also be referred to the left shoulder or arm. 4  Nausea. 5  Tenderness in the area. 6  Watch out for more severe symptoms such as changes in blood pressure, heart rate, confusion and loss of consciousness which indicate a more serious injury.

phylum traits of a starfish	Phylum. Starfish belong to the phylum Echinodermata, which is the largest phylum without any members that live on land or in fresh water. Echinoderms have five-point radial symmetry as adults, but are bilaterally symmetrical as larvae. They have an endoskeleton consisting of calcareous plates that often include spines. Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images. Although fish and starfish both belong to the kingdom Animalia -- which is the largest division of taxonomic classification -- starfish lack a spine, and therefore belong to a different phylum than true fish. For this reason, biologists refer to them as sea stars.The first echinoderms (called carpoids) did not have any radial symmetry which shows that this characteristic was acquired later in the group's evolutionary history. Echinoderms are often difficult animals to kill and many have well developed powers of regeneration. Early attempts to control the Crown-of-Thorns starfish by chopping it up into several pieces merely resulted in helping it disperse as each piece grew into a new animal. As you can see from this list they are a morphologically very diverse group, at first it may not be obvious how they are all related, but despite their various forms they do all possess the characteristics outlined above. They are an ancient and very successful phylum of invertebrates with around 6,000 living members.
what is a formal organization workplace	These social influences may cause a member of the informal organization to work in conjunction with the organization, in parallel with it, or even against it. In some respects, you can think of an informal organization as: 1  An organization within the formal organization working with it. 2  An organization beside the formal organization working towards the same goals but not necessarily together. 3  Or an organization working outside the formal organization and against it. Now, let's take a look at an informal organization. It's primarily a social creature-made up of the sum total of social norms, relationships, and interactions that affect how an organization works. While a formal organization is cold and impersonal, an informal organization is intensely personal.Jupiterimages/BananaStock/Getty Images. The concepts of formal and informal organizations relate to the nature of relationships and processes in the workplace. A formal organization is the literal structure of the organization including its organization chart, hierarchical reporting relationships and work processes. An organizational chart effectively outlines the structure of the formal organization. It shows the hierarchy from the CEO and top management to mid-level management to front-line employees. It also shows the horizontal interrelationships of various functional divisions or departments.
which part of the brain controls emotion - cerebral hemisphere	Cerebrum: Much of your brain function takes place in the cerebral cortex, or outer layer of the cerebrum. It's the assembly line of human thought where all the heavy work gets done. Left hemisphere: Controls your concrete side: speech, writing, language, and calculation. The cerebrum is divided into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The right hemisphere controls the muscles on the left side of the body. The left hemisphere controls the muscles on the righThe right and left hemispheres of the brain are joined by a bundle of fibers called the corpus callosum that delivers messages from one side to the other. Each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body. If a brain tumor is located on the right side of the brain, your left arm or leg may be weak or paralyzed. Not all functions of the hemispheres are shared. In general, the left hemisphere controls speech, comprehension, arithmetic, and writing. The brain is composed of three parts: the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebrum. The cerebrum is divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. 1  The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is composed of right and left hemispheres. It performs higher functions like interpreting touch, vision and hearing, as well as speech, reasoning, emotions, learning, and fine control of movement. The cerebellum is located under the cerebrum

why is urine used as test for diseases	Why It Is Done. A urine test may be done: 1  To check for a disease or infection of the urinary tract. 2  Symptoms of a urine infection may include colored or bad-smelling urine, pain when urinating, finding it hard to urinate, flank pain, blood in the urine (hematuria), or fever. Red blood cells in the urine may be caused by kidney or bladder injury, kidney stones, a urinary tract infection (UTI), inflammation of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), a kidney or bladder tumor, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).Urinalysis, also called a routine urine test, is used to check for abnormalities in the urine.Urine is liquid waste, which is made by the kidneys and stored in the bladder until it is eliminated by the body through urination. A number of diseases and conditions can result in abnormalities in the urine. These abnormalities often may be detected through physical, chemical, and microscopic examination. Urinalysis may be performed as part of a regular physical examination to screen for early signs of disease. In patients who have kidney disease or diabetes, urine tests are used to monitor the condition. Urinalysis also may be performed to detect a urinary tract infection (UTI) , protein in the urine (proteinuria), or blood in the urine (hematuria), and to diagnose pregnancy. Toxicology screening can be used as part of urinalysis to detect illegal drug use
how much ibuprofen does it take to overdose?	Animal research shows that the lethal dose that kills 50% of test animals (LD50) of oral ibuprofen is 636 mg/kg. If this value is applied to humans, it may take 191 tablets (200mg/tablet) or a total of 38,160 mg for a 60-kg man to die from acute ibuprofen overdose. The effects of ibuprofen at lesser doses (600-800mg) also include upset stomach, which can lead to internal bleeding and death, over a long time. You must also use the smallest dose necessary to obtain relief from your fever, pain, or swelling. Can you overdose on ibuprofen? For adults, the maximum dose of ibuprofen is 800 milligrams (mg) per dose. It may be taken up to a maximum of four doses per day or a total of 3200 mg daily.The answer to your question depends on how much your are taking, how often you are taking them, how long you taken them for, and what other problems may occur. It sounds like you are taking 600 mg (3 200 mg pills) four times per day. This is 2400 mg a day. This is close to the max that I would ever allow a patient to take. By the book, 3200 mg per day is the maximum safe dose. While at this dose you are unlikely to overdose, it is possible and even likely that you may develop a longer term complication from them. The first and most likely complication is a stomach ulcer. If you develop stomach pain or if your stools turn dark, this could mean that you have a stomach ulcer.
what is all the DNA in a cell called	DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladder’s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder. An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself.The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA. This genetic material is known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. Mitochondria (illustration) are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.
how long to thaw frozen turkey	Safely thawing a frozen turkey is one of the most important steps in preparing a meal. There are two recommended methods, depending on the amount of time available. Refrigerator thawing is preferred and the least labor-intensive but requires more time. Cold water thawing takes less time but requires more attention. Cold Water Thawing. 1  Thaw breast side down, in an unopened wrapper, with enough cold water to cover your turkey completely. 2  Change water every 30 minutes to keep the turkey chilled. 3  Estimate a minimum thawing time of 30 minutes per lb• Place the frozen turkey in the fridge — be sure your refrigerator temperature is set at 40 °F or below. • You’ll need to a llow about 24 hours for each 4 to 5 pounds of frozen turkey you plan to thaw in the fridge. Approximate times to defrost a whole turkey in the fridge: - 10 pounds — 2 days plus 12 hours - 15 pounds — 3 days plus 18 hours - 20 pounds — 5 days - 25 pounds — 6 days plus 6 hours. Check out this handy online calculator to determine how long it will take to defrost your frozen turkey. Another plus of thawing turkey in the refrigerator: If your plans change and you decide not to cook the turkey at all, you can safely refreeze the defrosted turkey within 1 to 2 days (although there may be some loss of quality). 2. Cold Water Thawing. You can defrost your frozen turkey much faster in cold water.
what is tigernut milk	Try Tigernut Milk! While I believe raw milk boasts unique health benefits, dairy isn’t tolerated by everyone. Many people reach for nut or seed milks as an alternative to dairy milk. I do not recommend the nut/seed milks available in cartons at the store. These contain a slew of problematic ingredients including: 1  inflammatory carrageenan. 2  synthetic vitamins. Ingredients. 1  1 cup tigernuts, available here. 2  4 cups filtered water (this is the water filter I use to remove chlorine and fluoride). 3  1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, optional. 4  1/4 tsp. cinnamon. 5  1 Tbs. 6  maple syrup, raw honey or other preferred sweetener, optional. 7  Pinch of unrefined salt.While I still love coconut milk (and almond and cashew milk on occasion), I was looking for something different. Tigernut milk delivers. The slightly sweet, nutty flavor comes through in the milk and it is delicious mixed with smoothies, coffee, tea, or plain. It is super easy to make and can be flavored in a huge variety of ways. Tigernut milk is sometimes referred to as tigernut horchata. 1 Puree on high until smooth and creamy (2-4 minutes, depending on the blender). 2  Pour through a fine mesh strainer, nut bag, cheese cloth, etc. to separate the milk from the pureed tigernuts. 3  Place the tigernut puree back in the blender and add another 1-2 cups of water. 4  Puree again for a couple minutes.

We eat the root of the onion plant but can also eat thestems, for a milder flavor.Some of the plants we eat are poisonous—if we eat the wrong part.The leaves of tomato plants are poisonous. For many years peoplewould not even eat tomatoes, because they thought the entire plant waspoisonous.e-mail. A. Voles (think V for vegetarian) attack plant roots and parts.Moles (think M for meat or carnivorous) attack grub worms and earthworms. You know a vole has eaten your plant when there's no root system to support the plant and it topples over if you merely touch it. You will also see small holes with pushed-up soil near the base of the plant. Small gravel, or products called perlite and Vole-Bloc, can be used to deter voles
what age do you stop having menstrual cycles	The menstrual cycle is from Day 1 of bleeding to Day 1 of the next time of bleeding. Although the average cycle is 28 days, it is normal to have a cycle that is shorter or longer. Girls usually start having menstrual periods between the ages of 11 and 14. Women usually start to have fewer periods between ages 39 and 51. Women in their 40s and teens may have cycles that are longer or change a lot. If you are a teen, your cycles should even out with time. If you are nearing menopause, your cycles will probably get longer and then will stop. Talk to your doctor if you notice any big change in your cycle. It's especially important to check with your doctor if you have three or more menstrual periods that last longer than 7 days or are very heavy.Evaluate the contraceptives you're taking. If you missed a period while on birth control pills, your period may be irregular or absent longterm depending on how you use the medication and your body's reaction to it. 1  Oral contraceptives typically come in 21 day packs with 7 days worth of inactive placebo pills. 1 You should get in the habit of tracking your cycle as you reach your early 40s as menopause can start during this time. 2  A simple dot on a calendar can be a good indicator of when your period began. 3  If your menstrual period has been absent for a year, you are in menopause. 4  Your period will not return.
time zone differences between eastern and mountain time	• The time difference between Mountain Time and Eastern Time is two hours. • Mountain Time and Eastern Time are two standard time zones in North America. • The Mountain Time zone is ahead of the Pacific Time Zone by one hour and is behind the Central Time Zone by one hour. • Mountain Time is arrived at by subtracting 7 hours from the UTC during the shortest days of autumn and winter; UTC – 7. It is important to note that both Mountain Time and Eastern Time keep time by referring to UTC. Mountain Time can be calculated by subtracting 7 hours from UTC. Eastern Time can be calculated by subtracting 5 hours from UTC. However, these times are adjusted by one hour during the day light saving period. More information about the two time zones will be discussed in this articleCentral Time vs Mountain Time. USA is a very large country in terms of both area and population. This is why moving from east to west the country has been divided into 4 time zones namely Eastern Standard Time, Central Standard Time, the Mountain Standard Time, and finally the Pacific Standard Time. • Mountain Time Zone is 7 hours behind GMT. • MST = GMT/UTC-7 and MDT = GMT/UTC-6. • Central Time Zone is ahead of the Mountain Time Zone by an hour. • CST = MST+1; When MST is 12.00 PM, CST is 1.00 PM.

what does the muscular foot do	Your tarsal bones are connected to the front and back of your foot by muscles and the arch ligament (the plantar fascia). They act as shock absorbers when we’re walking or running. The front of your foot (forefoot) is made up of your toe bones (phalanges), which are connected to five long bones (metatarsals) by joints. Many common problems can occur in this complicated area. The foot is usually separated into three different parts: The back of your foot (hindfoot) is made up of your heel bone (calcaneus) and your ankle (talus). They’re joined together by your subtalar joint, which allows your foot to move from side to side. Your ankle bone is joined to your leg bones (tibia and fibula) at your ankle joint, which acts like a hinge. This allows your foot to bend up and down. The middle of your foot (midfoot) is made up of five tarsal boneThe muscles acting on the foot can be divided into two distinct groups; extrinsic and intrinsic muscles. 1  The extrinsic muscles arise from the anterior, posterior and lateral compartments of the leg. 2  They are mainly responsible for actions such as eversion, inversion, plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the foot. 1 The extrinsic muscles arise from the anterior, posterior and lateral compartments of the leg. 2  They are mainly responsible for actions such as eversion, inversion, plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the foot.
vitamins and minerals that cause itchy scalp	6 Signs of Biotin Deficiency are: 1. Dermatitis. Skin inflammation is one of the common symptoms of biotin deficiency. The common form of dermatitis that is found in people who are suffering from biotin deficiency is seborrhoeic dermatitis. This disease causes flaking and itching on the scalp that may lead to balding. Children who are affected by this condition may suffer from muscle pain and hair problems. Symptoms such as thinning of hair, red-scaly skin and brittle nails are common signs of biotin deficiency. 6 Signs of Biotin Deficiency. Biotin is a form of Vitamin B complex, and it is a crucial vitamin required for synthesizing carbohydrates and fatty acids in the human body. This vitamin is manufactured from food by bacteria that is present in the intestinal track of the body.Foods for Dry & Itchy Scalp. One of the more obvious causes of chronic dandruff and/or dry scalp is vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Try to eat more of the following foods, to increase your intake of zinc, Vitamin A, B vitamins and Omega 3 Fatty Acids: 1  Eggs, sweet potatoes, carrots, papaya (Vitamin A). Problems with fungi (and bacteria) are likely caused by your scalp being to alkali. This happens when you use hair products that remove the acidic sebum protecting your scalp against fungi and bacteria. 3. Scalp psoriasis – Psoriasis can cause dandruff-like itching and flaking.

taiga biome average rainfall	The average winter temperature is around -4°F and the average summer temperature is around 65°F. Precipitation in the taiga mostly falls during the summer. It has an average annual rainfall of 12 - 33 inches (30 - 84 cm). The climate during the summer is warm and humid. During the winter there is some precipitation, snow. In the taiga there are many extremes in the weather. The lowest temperature in the taiga is -76°F in the coldest part of winter. The highest temperature is +104°F during the middle of summer.The average precipitation per year is about 40 inches. The average precipitation for the summer is between 10-20 inches. The average precipitation for the winter is between 20-40 inches. The type of precipitation that falls in the taiga climate are rain in summer and mostly snow in winter. Something I find interesting about the climate of this biome is that the temperature can change from one extreme to another. For half of the year, the average temperature is below freezing. In the winter the average air temperature is warmer than it is for tundra, which lies north of the taiga. The taiga climate has an average annual rainfall of 12 - 33 inches (30 - 84 cm). Most of it falls in the summer as rain. The corresponding biome would be the Taiga biome. The global range for taiga goes all around the world from Alaska, to Canada, Scandinavia, Russia and China
kimchi what is it	Kimchi’s flavor also varies on the length of fermentation, the vegetables used and amount of salt and sugar. In Korea, kimchi is served as a side dish or appetizer in all occasions. It is also served with their daily meals and used in a variety of dishes like Kimchi Jjigae, a traditional stew made with kimchi. Kimchi is originally from Korea and it is made of a wide array of vegetables, ginger, chili peppers, garlic, fish and salt. The mixing of the different ingredients makes it well preserved for winter season. Common ingredients of kimchi are cabbage, radish, scallions and cucumber. Kimchi is a dish with a hundreds of recipes that varies depending on the season and region in which they were produced. Kimchi’s main flavors are spicy, sour and umami. Its flavors will also depend on what the recipe isKimchi (Hangul: 김치; [kimtɕʰi] ; English pronunciation: /ˈkɪmtʃi/), also spelled kimchee or gimchi, is a traditional fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables with a variety of seasonings. In traditional preparation, kimchi was stored underground in jars to keep cool during the summer months and unfrozen during the winter months. White radish kimchi (dongchimi) is another example of a kimchi that is not spicy. The watery white kimchi varieties are sometimes used as an ingredient in a number of dishes such as cold noodles in dongchimi brine (dongchimi guksu).

What it does: Promotes a healthy immune system and helps make collagen. It's also needed to make certain chemical messengers in the brain. Vitamin D. Food sources include: Fortified milk, cheese, and cereals; egg yolks; salmon. What it does: Maintains bone health and helps the body process calcium; important for immune system function; may protect from cancer. What it does: Helps with digestion and changing food into energy; helps make cholesterol. Vitamin B6. Food sources include: Fortified cereals, fortified soy-based meat substitutes, baked potatoes with skin, bananas, light-meat chicken and turkey, eggs, and spinach. What it does: Supports your nervous system.Some minerals, like iodine and fluoride, are only needed in very small quantities. Others, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, are needed in larger amounts. As with vitamins, if you eat a varied diet, you will probably get enough of most minerals. Your doctor might suggest that, like some older adults, you need extra of a few vitamins, as well as the mineral calcium. It is usually better to get the nutrients you need from food, rather than a pill. That’s because nutrient-dense foods contain other things that are good for you like fiber.
does rubbing alcohol help remove stains	Rubbing alcohol will help remove dog ticks. Ticks don't like rubbing alcohol. Before you pull a tick off your dog put some rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rub it on the tick. This will make the tick loosen its grip and make it easier for you to remove it. Once the tick is removed dab again with alcohol to disinfect the wound. 1  This works on people too. Soak the spot in rubbing alcohol for a few minutes before you put it in the washer. You can also use rubbing alcohol to remove ink stains around the house. ** See more of my articles on uses for ordinary things in the resource section below.Most stains can be treated with a homemade stain remover-the very same rubbing alcohol that you probably keep around the house for cuts and scrapes. To remove stains with alcohol, follow these steps. Instructions. Place a paper towel, folded twice, inside the article of clothing and behind the stain. Put some rubbing alcohol on a sponge and blot the stain. Turn the fabric over so that the stain is face down, and put it on top of a fresh twice-folded paper towel. Make sure you can get to the stain and use the alcohol-soaked sponge to blot more. After you are done, replace the paper towel with a fresh one. Add liquid laundry detergent to a fresh area of the sponge and gently rub the stain. You will probably need to replace the paper towel another time while doing thi
does wine acidity matter in fermentation	During fermentation, yeasts transform sugars present in the juice into ethanol and carbon dioxide (as a by-product). In winemaking, the temperature and speed of fermentation are important considerations as well as the levels of oxygen present in the must at the start of the fermentation. The absence of oxygen in this anaerobic process allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted, by reduction, to ethanol. During the conversion of acetaldehyde, a small amount is converted, by oxidation, to acetic acid which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity (vinegar taint). After the yeast has exhausted its life cycle, they fall to the bottom of the fermentation tank as sediment known as leesIf after conducting an acidity test of your wine, you discover that your wine lacks the correct amount of acid, the simplest solution would be to add an appropriate amount of acid blend to your must prior to fermentation. But we can't do that unless we know our desired acid levels. Recommended Acidity Levels. Before we jump into our discussion of how to measure acidity in wine, it's paramount to first understand why acid levels are important to the winemaker. Acidity provides the crisp, slightly tart taste of wine on your palate. Too little acid, and your wine tastes flabby and non-committal. Too much acid, and your taste buds scream for relief

how long does it take for food to digest and come out	When it comes to our digestive system, it can take hours or even longer for food to pass through. That's what it takes for the body to get the nutrients and energy it needs from what you ingest. It usually takes from 24 to 72 hours for healthy people to completely digest food and eliminate waste products. The first stop for food is the esophagus, which moves food from the back of the throat to the stomach. About six to eight hours after eating, food passes through the stomach and small intestine. The actual amount of time that this process takes depends on the food you're eating. Meat can take two days to fully digest, while vegetables and fruits take a day or less. Drinking water and high-fiber foods helps the digestive system work more efficiently.Digestion time varies between individuals and between men and women. After you eat, it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Food then enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion, absorption of water and, finally, elimination of undigested food. In the 1980s, Mayo Clinic researchers measured digestion time in 21 healthy people. Total transit time, from eating to elimination in stool, averaged 53 hours (although that figure is a little overstated, because the markers used by the researchers passed more slowly through the stomach than actual food).
rate of cholesterol for a woman	Healthy Cholesterol Levels. The recommended HDL level is higher in women than men. Aim to keep your total cholesterol level less than 200 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL. The desired HDL level is greater than 50 mg/dL and levels greater than 60 mg/dL are considered protective against heart disease. Seventy-one million adults in the United States are affected by high LDL cholesterol, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is important to be aware of your cholesterol levels because a high cholesterol level double your risk for developing cardiovascular disease. The recommended level of cholesterol differs slightly for men and women and knowing your numbers is the first step in keeping your cholesterol at a healthy level1 People with high total cholesterol have approximately twice the risk of heart disease as people with optimal levels. 2  A desirable level is lower than 200 mg/dL. 3  For adult Americans, the average level is about 200 mg/dL, which is borderline high risk. 4  More women than men have high cholesterol in the United States. 1 More than 200,000 women die each year from heart attacks-five times as many women as breast cancer. 2  More than 159,000 women die each year of congestive heart failure, accounting for 56.3% of all heart failure deaths. 3  48% of adult women have a total cholesterol of at least 200mg/dL.
how long koi can lay eggs	Koi offspring will usually hatch after 3 to 7 days, depending on the water temperature. If the water temperature is around 20 degrees C/ 68 degrees F, the eggs will hatch after 3-4 days. You know that the hatching will take place within a day when the eggs develop a special shiny look. When the female deposit her eggs at the spawning mop, the males will immediately fertilize them. The spawning mops can then be removed and placed in the fry raising pond. During Koi breeding, it can be a good idea to add 0.2 mg of malachite green for each liter of water in the fry raising pond to prevent fungus attacks.Immature Koi may also eat the eggs, so if you want to rear them, you should separate the spawning Koi from others in the pond. Incubating Koi Eggs The incubator should have a reasonable capacity. A water storage tank about 100 gallons is ideal, and should be made of non-toxic materials. The day before the Koi hatches the eyes in the egg will have a shine to them. Soon afterwards, the young Koi will begin to wriggle then, gradually, over the next few hours, it will break out of its 'shell'. It will take three to four days for the Koi eggs to develop and the fry to hatch at temperatures of 68 -7l. Koi fry can develop at temperatures as low as 63, in which case their incubation will take five or six days, or as high as 77, which will decrease their hatching time
how to keep snakes from bird houses	Pre-drill two 5/16 inch holes through both the conduit or pipe and the back of the box. Use 1/4 inch bolts for anchoring the box to the pole. The drilling can be done before placement in the field. Wrap two pieces of pipe strap around the pole and screw into the back of the box on either side of the pole. Secure another small piece of pipe strap to the back top and bend it down into the pole to keep the box from turning. Place two electrical conduit hangers around the pole and screw into the box. A 10 foot piece of 3/4 inch EMT electrical conduit pipe can be purchased for a reasonable price. It will then need to be cut down to a length of approximately 8 feet, to place 2 feet of pipe in the ground and 6 feet of pipe above. The electrical conduit is zinc plated and will keep its slick surface for many years.1 Roof Size: Large predators such as squirrels, cats and raccoons may sit on a bird house roof and reach inside to attack the nesting birds or chicks. 2  A longer roof that extends 5-6 inches in front of the house provides a built-in baffle to limit predators' reach and prevent them from accessing the entrance. 1 This also helps prevent larger birds from using the house, either as predators or to usurp the nesting site. 2  Hole restrictors are also a great way to adjust bird houses to have the proper entrance hole size for only the desired bird species.
Kelp forests are usually found at what depths?	Kelp forests provide food and shelter for thousands of species. In ideal conditions, kelp can grow up to. per day, and in stark contrast to the colorful and slow-growing corals, the giant kelp canopies tower above the ocean floor. Like trees in a forest, these giant algae provide food and shelter for many organisms. Also like a terrestrial forest, kelp forests experience seasonal changes. Among the many mammals and birds that use kelp forests for protection or feeding include seals, sea lions, whales, sea otters, gulls, terns, snowy egrets, great blue herons, cormorants, and shore birds. These dense canopies of algae generally occur in cold, nutrient-rich waters.Kelp forests provide habitat for a variety of invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, and birds. Many species of fish and marine mammals inhabit kelp forests for protection and food. In kelp forests, the most commonly found invertebrates are bristle worms, scud, prawn, snails, and brittle stars. These animals feed on the holdfasts that keep kelp anchored to the bottom of the ocean and algae that are abundant in kelp forests. Sea urchins will often completely remove kelp plants by eating through their holdfasts. Other invertebrates found in kelp forests are sea stars, anemones, crabs, and jellyfish. A wide range of fish can be found in kelp forests, many of which are important to commercial fishermen.
what are fissures granite	The Difference Between Cracks and Fissures in Granite. When choosing a granite slab or perhaps admiring your newly installed countertops, you may notice intermittent lines in the stone. Do not panic! Some people assume that these are cracks and that the integrity of their countertops will be compromised, but in most cases there is nothing to worry about. The difference between a crack and a natural granite fissure is an important aspect of enjoying the natural beauty of granite. A fissure in a slab of granite is a natural cleft in the rock caused by God or “Nature”. When the stones form underground, a gap may develop in the material for any number of reasons, and this gap presents as a fissure when the slabs are mined from the groundFissures in Granite Countertops. Fissures in granite are incredibly common, especially in slabs with a large dramatic design. In the slab yard, with the slab sitting vertically, these fissures are present and yet not so easily recognized. In the excitement of choosing an exquisite slab it's easy to stand back and focus on the slab as a whole instead. Actual cracks will be different in composition than fissures. Cracks are not solid, so they will have an opening that debris can fall into. If you find cracks like the one shown below in your countertop, your granite company should be able to help you fill and hide them from view.

what is a financier dessert	A financier is a small French cake. The financier is light and moist, similar to sponge cake, and usually contains almond flour, crushed or ground almonds, or almond flavoring. The distinctive feature of the recipe is beurre noisette. Other ingredients include egg whites, flour, and powdered sugar. Financiers are baked in shaped molds, usually small rectangular loaves similar in size to petits fours. In terms of texture, it is springy with a crisp, eggshell-like exterior. The name financier is said to derive from the traditional rectangular mold, which resembles a bar of gold. Another theory says that the cake became popular in the financial district of Paris surrounding the Paris stock exchange. Financier pans are traditionally rectangular, but other shapes are not uncommon.At the Tonic, cranberries are dropped into the batter, and the finished financier is served warm between a tangy creme fraiche sorbet and a tart huckleberry chutney. At La Fourchette, a boat-shape ginger lemon financier is showered with powdered sugar, with creme fraiche ice cream and blueberries spooned on the side. But such simplicity is deceiving: the classic French pastry called the financier is exquisitely refined. It is springy, sweet and nutty with an exterior that's as crisp as an eggshell. In France, financiers have been a staple of fine pastry shops for more than 100 years.

This second type is exhibited by starfish, for example. What kind of symmetry does gastropoda have? already exists. already exists as an alternate of this question. exists and is an alternate of. Most customers will probably want more than one emberlight, in order to cover a large portion of their home. On average, how many emberlight plugins do you expect a customer will buy? What kind of symmetry ...Many snails have an operculum, a horny plate that seals the opening when the snail's body is drawn into the shell. Gastropods have a muscular foot which is used for creeping locomotion in most species. In some, it is modified for swimming or burrowing. Most gastropods have a well-developed head that includes eyes, 1-2 pairs of tentacles, and a concentration of nervous tissue (ganglion). Gastropods are characterized by torsion, a process that results in the rotation of the visceral mass and mantle on the foot. The result is that the mantle cavity (including anus) lies in the anterior body, over the head and mouth, and the gut and nervous system are twisted.

what is an example of a beta particle	After a radioactive nucleus has emitted a beta particle, the mass number stays the same and the atomic number goes up by 1. A neutron in the nucleus has changed into a proton plus an electron. The proton stays inside the nucleus but the electron is emitted as a beta particle. Some nuclei can decay by emitting either an alpha particle or a beta particle. An example is bismuth where 1/3 of the atoms emit an alpha particle and 2/3 of the atoms emit a beta particle. You can work out which particle is emitted by balancing the equation.A beta particle (in this case a negative electron) is shown being emitted by a nucleus. An antineutrino (not shown) is always emitted along with an electron. Insert: in the decay of free neutron, a proton, an electron (negative beta ray), and an electron antineutrino are produced. Beta radiation, consisting of electrons or positrons, is halted by an aluminum plate. Gamma radiation is damped by lead. Beta particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by certain types of radioactive nuclei, such as potassium-40. The beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation also known as beta rays. The production of beta particles is termed beta decay. They are designated by the Greek letter beta (β). There are two forms of beta decay, β − and β + , which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron
what causes curly hair	Anyone with curly hair knows that this hair type can be dry, hard to manage, and often frizzy. The good news is that people with curly hair tend to have fewer split ends than people with straight hair.

what is a meteor made of	A meteor is an asteroid or other object that burns and vaporizes upon entry into the Earth's atmosphere; meteors are commonly known as shooting stars.. If a meteor survives the plunge through the atmosphere and lands on the surface, it's known as a meteorite. Meteorites are usually categorized as iron or stony. As the name implies, iron meteorites are composed of about 90 percent iron; stony meteorites are made up of oxygen, iron, silicon, magnesium and other elements. The terms asteroid, meteor, meteorite and meteoroid get tossed around recklessly, especially when two of them threaten the Earth on the same day. Here's a quick explainer: An asteroid is a rocky object in space that's smaller than a planet — they're sometimes called minor planets or planetoids, according to NASA.Quatr.us Physics Space. Meteor. Meteors or meteorites are bits of rock (like granite) and ice-usually a mixture of rock and iron and nickel but sometimes just rock or just iron-from out in space that get sucked into the gravity of the Earth and fall through our atmosphere to the ground. A meteor is the same thing as a shooting star or a falling star-they're not really falling stars, but some people call them that. Meteors look like stars as they fall because when they hit Earth's atmosphere the friction of the rock rubbing against the atmosphere causes heat and light, like a fire.
impact invention of the steam engine had	Before the invention of the steam engine, people used the power provided by animals, wind and water to farm, mill flour and transport goods and people from place to place. But none of these sources of energy were as reliable or perpetually renewable as steam. The invention of a practical steam engine had an immediate effect on employment, first in Great Britain and later around the world. England had huge natural resources of coal that could fuel steam engines, and this drove the creation of mills and factories that turned out the goods that people had been creating by hand.By the early 1800s, high-pressure steam engines had become compact enough to move beyond the factory, prompting the first steam-powered locomotive to hit the rails in Britain in 1804. For the first time in history, goods were transported over land by something other than the muscle of man or animal. Scientists began tinkering seriously with steam in the early 1600s and, like most inventions of the day, it was a team effort that ultimately led to the first working steam engine. In 1698, British inventor Thomas Savery patented a steam-powered pump, which he described as an engine to raise water by fire.. Savery's very basic engine relied on steam to create a vacuum and pull water upwards through a pipe — a theory that had been around for several centuries but never successfully applied
how did the failure of the schlieffen plan lead to a stalemate	The goals of the schlieffen plan was to surround Paris and force France into a quick surrender. The schlieffen plan was to move quickly through Belgium, which failed, as Germa … n troops were held in Belgium for 6 weeks.

It was the failure of the Schlieffen Plan in 1914 that led to the creation of stalemate on the Western Front (Webb). The German offensive; Schlieffen plan failed due to differences in the way the plan was performed compared to the way the plan was actually planned. Problems led to battles, which lead to defeats for the Germans and eventually the forced abandonment (due to failure) of the Schlieffen Plan. As the Germans were defeated they secured some land, 'dug in', the trench system was established. The Schlieffen plan and the 'war of movement' was over. Stalemate was established and would not be broken until 1918. The consolidated trench system secured and gave confidence to both armies defensively. Both had strong backing and resting places (esp.

describe relationship between vaccination and immunity	Vaccine Immunity. By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD. The immune system of the body functions to protect it against invasion by germs and microbes. When an individual is vaccinated against a disease or an infection, his or her immune system is prepared to fight the infection. Once vaccinated, when the person is exposed to the bacterium that causes it, the body gears up to fight off the infection. This is a mild episode that often goes unnoticed by the sufferer. B cells. B cells are important in secreting and manufacturing antibodies against the specified antigens of the invading microbes. Antibodies usually work by first latching on to the recognized antigen and then sticking to and coating the microbe.The vaccination is the introduction of the pathogen in tiny amounts to kick start your immune system so it knows how to deal with the real thing if you encounter the germ in the environment. A vaccine is the medicine made to introduce the pathogen (infection-causing bug) into your body in a vaccination. Having immunity is how your body prevents a second infection by the same germ. The first time you catch the germ (or get a vaccination for it), your body responds to cause immunity, so if you run across the same exact germ again later, your body already knows how to prevent an infection again. See the related questions below for more about vaccines and vaccinations.

spray foam price per sqft	There are two general types of spray foam that are commonly used; closed cell and open cell foam. Closed cell spray foam insulation is mainly used with sub-floors, and is applied at a two inch average. The average estimated cost for this application is usually around $1.75 per square foot. Closed cell spray foam insulation is also very suitable with metal roofing and metal walls. Open cell spray foam insulation is the most common used of the two, it is generally used in walls and roof lines for wood structure homes. The average estimated cost for this application is usually around $1.15 per square foot for wall cavities and is applied at three inches. Roof lines are around $1.50 per square foot and is applied at a five inch average to the underside of the roof deck, not the ceiling floor. With that said, in some cases open cell spray foam is applied to the bottom of a ceiling floor, but it’s not common.Open-cell spray foam has an R-value of about 3.5 to 3.7 per inch and typically uses water as a blowing agent, while closed-cell foam has an R-value of about 6 per inch, he adds. Costs, at least in McGraw’s area, average about 80 cents a square foot for open-cell foam and about $1.20 per square foot for closed-cell foam. With those R-values in mind, Jacobs will have trouble meeting energy code recommendations for his region if he goes with open-cell foam.
what size board do i need for stair riser	This tells us that we need 5 risers each 7-3/8 tall-you can use the Feet-Inch Calculator to convert any decimal number to an equivalent fractional length. To learn all about code requirements for stairs and how to build them step-by-step, check out the section on Stairs and Railings. If you don't like to use fuzzy rules of thumb, check out the stair rise/run table. To figure out what the exact riser height should be, we divide the distance from the top of the deck to the ground. Whatever number we choose for our riser must divide evenly into that total height measurement.When building deck stairs you will need to determine the total height of the deck at the stairs. This is the change in elevation from the top of the deck to where you expect the stairs to land. Place a level straight out from the deck and measure to the ground or landing using a tape measurer. You will also need to establish the tread depth and riser height for each step. The minimum tread depth is 10 and the maximum riser height is 8. In most cases this will be a 7-1/2 rise and 10-1/2 run. This will allow you to use two deck boards for each tread with a 1/2 reveal. Once you have determined the total stair height, tread depth, and riser height you can plug the numbers into the decks.com stair stringer calculator to find the stringer length, stair projection, and the angle of the stairs

what are signs of lyme disease in humans	Early Signs and Symptoms (3 to 30 days after tick bite). 1  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes. 2  Erythema migrans (EM) rash: 3  Occurs in approximately 70 to 80 percent of infected persons. 4  Begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3 to 30 days (average is about 7 days). Untreated Lyme disease can produce a wide range of symptoms, depending on the stage of infection. These include fever, rash, facial paralysis, and arthritis. Seek medical attention if you observe any of these symptoms and have had a tick bite, live in an area known for Lyme disease, or have recently traveled to an area where Lyme disease occursYou may first notice symptoms weeks to months after the tick bite. If the disease isn't treated, it may progress from mild symptoms to serious, long-term disabilities. 1  In the first stage, you may have a rash (erythema migrans) at the site of the tick bite. 2  You may also have a lack of energy or a headache and stiff neck. 3  Sometimes people have no symptoms at this stage. 1 In the first stage, you may have a rash (erythema migrans) at the site of the tick bite. 2  You may also have a lack of energy or a headache and stiff neck. 3  Sometimes people have no symptoms at this stage. 4  In the second stage, symptoms may include memory problems and pain and weakness in the arms and legs.
mechanism of action describes how a drug produces its effects	LSD is the abbreviation of the German words for lysergic acid diethylamide. It is the drug most commonly identified with the term hallucinogen and the most widely used in this class of drugs. It is considered the typical hallucinogen, and the characteristics of its action and effects apply to other hallucinogens.t is the drug most commonly identified with the term hallucinogen and the most widely used in this class of drugs. It is considered the typical hallucinogen, and the characteristics of its action and effects apply to other hallucinogens.In pharmacology, the term mechanism of action (MOA) refers to the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect. A mechanism of action usually includes mention of the specific molecular targets to which the drug binds, such as an enzyme or receptor.Receptor sites have specific affinities for drugs based on the chemical structure of the drug, as well as the specific action that occurs there.Drugs that do not bind to receptors produce their corresponding therapeutic effect by simply interacting with chemical or physical properties in the body.or example, the mechanism of action of aspirin involves irreversible inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, therefore suppressing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, thereby reducing pain and inflammation.
how to retrieve a lost item from uber without the account information	UberX, Uber Phone Number: Find out the faster way to customer service care contact number. This is the direct way to get phone number, you can always send a contact request: http://support.uber.com/hc/en-us/requests/new. But as for now there is no direct Uber customer service care contact phone number: 1-800-000-000 for Uber. You just have this request page using which you can expect a call back sooner or later. Uber request can be used if customer have lost item in an Uber car and would like to get Uber driver’s contact phone number. My opinion is that Uber customers should use this tool provided by Uber to their benefit. If it is removed their application will become inefficient like Taxi and become unpopular. Tips from uber phone number dot com on how to order your uberx and uber rides in a better way; 1. Checking the location is very important.Uber stressed the customer service factor of allowing a rider to have access to the driver’s dummy number indefinitely, noting that many of their drivers have given the company positive feedback about the system because they are more quickly able to return lost items. The waybill is visible to the driver within the app until the next trip request is accepted.” While a user’s Uber profile only shows the first name and a small picture, the driver does have access to the full name as soon as the ride is ordered.
how long to run pool filter each day	I'm trying to determine how long I actually have to run my pool filter per day, but my maths are not adding up. Most places on the internet (that I've come across), recommend 8-12 hours per day. The maths I've done, says ~4 hours per day. The documentation that came with the filter lists a Design Flow Rate of 100 gallons per minute (GPM), and an 8 hour turnover of 48,000 gallons. Hayward XStream® Filtration. Based on all this, it seems that if I run the filter for 8 hours, I'll have turned the water over more than 4 times. Is this really the case? Could I run the filter for only 4 hours a day, and still meet the recommended 2 turns per day? Using 100 GPM rate, and the capacity of the pool1 to 2 hours.    Another user said:   If by the pool filter, you mean how long to run the pool pump to  circulate water, I have been advised by pool pros to run it  according to the hours of daylight at the time. e.g., in the summer  run it 12 to 14 hours and in the winter, 8 hours. Last, divide the gallons, G, by the flow rate, F, to get the number of minutes you need to run the filter to turn (filter) all of the water once. For example, if I have a 5000 gal pool and a pump rated at 25 gallons per minute, it will take 200 minutes (or about 3 hrs and 20 min) to filter all of the water once. Multiply the time by 2 if you want to turn the water over twice (6 hrs, 40 min)
where can a hernia occur	A hernia occurs when an organ pushes through an opening in the muscle or tissue that holds it in place. For example, the intestines may break through a weakened area in the abdominal wall. Hernias are most common in the abdomen. However, they can also appear in the upper thigh, belly button, and groin regions. Hernias are caused by a combination of muscle weakness and strain. A hernia can develop quickly or over a long period of time, depending on its cause. Common causes of muscle weakness include: 1  failure of the abdominal wall to close properly in the womb (congenital defect). 2  age. 3  chronic coughing. 4  damage from injury or surgery.Hiatal hernias occur when part of the stomach slides through the opening in the diaphragm where the esophagus passes from the chest into the abdomen. A sliding hiatal hernia is the most common type and occurs when the lower esophagus and portions of the stomach slide through the diaphragm into the chest. Paraesophageal hernias occur when only the stomach herniates into the chest alongside the esophagus. Incisional hernias occur as a complication of abdominal surgery, where the abdominal muscles are cut to allow the surgeon to enter the abdominal cavity to operate. Although the muscle is usually repaired, it becomes a relative area of weakness, potentially allowing abdominal organs to herniate through the incision.
what is the function of shallow aquifers?	The shallow aquifer system typically is the first groundwater source encountered below the surface; it is the predominant water supply for a majority of wells in the county and is the primary source of water that supports the base flows of streams and ecologically sensitive wetlands and riparian areas. This valley aquifer system is the preeminent source of water for the greater Indianapolis area and supports the preponderance of manufacturing, energy-generation, and other water-intensive activities in the valley. Other aquifers and aquifer systems are also present at greater depth below the shallow aquifer system. These deeper water-bearing units include a variety of both large and small sand and gravel bodies as well as transmissive zones within the Silurian and Devonian carbonate rockIf the saturated thickness of the aquifer prior to pumping is 80 m, determine the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material. E Explain why it is not recommended to use the water level in the abstraction well to help determine aquifer properties during a pumping test. The following equation can be used to determine the radius of influence (R 0): ⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛= × × StR 0 2. 25 T (6.1) where, R 0 is the radius of influence (m) 2 T is the aquifer transmissivity (m /day) t is time (day) S is the storativity This equation can be applied for a pumping well in a confined aquifer.
how will a kitten be to take milk	You can start weaning at four weeks of age. Milk Replacement Formulas. Powdered kitten milk replacement formula is better for kittens than the canned liquid formula. We recommend that you use only powdered kitten milk replacement formula from the start — or as soon as possible — to prevent diarrhea. The best food for the kittens is their mother’s milk. Remove the kittens only if they are in immediate, grave danger. If the mother cat returns…. The mother cat offers her newborn kittens their best chance for survival, so wait and watch as long as you safely can for her to return before removing them.Kittens need milk for the first several weeks of their lives. The kittens’ mother provides the best milk for their needs at that age. However, you may feed orphan kittens goat’s milk, available at many large grocery stores or supermarkets. You can also feed them kitten milk replacement formula. Cow’s milk can upset a kitten’s stomach and should be used as a last resort. Kittens should be drinking water by the time they are 4 to 6 weeks of age. Orphaned kittens should drink milk, but older kittens and cats may not tolerate it well. Imagine a kitten. Chances are you imagined a kitten drinking from a bowl of milk, possibly with a bow around her neck. However, kittens who are old enough to separate from their mothers are old enough to drink water instead of milk.
what is a chocoholic	Chocolate /ˈtʃɒkᵊlət/ is a typically sweet, usually brown, food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground, often flavored, as with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other sweet foods. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this sweet chocolate, and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.A chocoholic is a person who craves or compulsively consumes chocolate. There is some medical evidence to support the existence of actual addiction to chocolate. However, the term is mostly used loosely or humorously to describe a person who is inordinately fond of chocolate. The word chocoholic was first used in 1968 according to Merriam-Webster. It is a portmanteau of  chocolate  and  alcoholic . 'Chocoholism' is quite common. In studies of food cravings, chocolate and chocolate confectioneries almost always top the list of foods people say they crave. The essential components of addiction are intense craving for something, loss of control over the use of it, and continued use despite negative consequences. Studies have shown that people can exhibit all three of these components in relation to food, particularly food that contains sugar or fat.
what is beta carotene good for in the body	The human body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A (retinol) - beta-carotene is a precursor of vitamin A. We need vitamin A for healthy skin and mucus membranes, our immune system, and good eye health and vision. Beta-carotene in itself is not an essential nutrient, but vitamin A is. Vitamin A can be sourced from the food we eat, through beta-carotene, for example, or in supplement form. The advantage of dietary beta-carotene is that the body only converts as much as it needs. Excess vitamin A is toxic.The richest sources of beta-carotene are yellow, orange, and green leafy fruits and vegetables (such as carrots, spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, broccoli, cantaloupe, and winter squash). In general, the more intense the color of the fruit or vegetable, the more beta-carotene it has. Beta-carotene is a pigment found in plants that gives them their color. The name beta-carotene is derived from the Latin name for carrot. It gives yellow and orange fruits and vegetables their rich hues. Beta-carotene is also used to color foods such as margarine. In the body, beta-carotene converts into vitamin A (retinol). We need vitamin A for good vision and eye health, for a strong immune system, and for healthy skin and mucous membranes. Taking big doses of vitamin A can be toxic, but your body only converts as much vitamin A from beta-carotene as it need
what were the territorial changes of the treaty of versailles	It ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I were dealt with in separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919, and was printed in The League of Nations Treaty Series. Russia was also excluded because it had negotiated a separate peace (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) with Germany in 1918. The terms of this treaty awarded Germany a large proportion of Russia's land and resources.The territorial changes of Germany include all changes in the borders and territory of Germany from its formation in 1871 to the present. Modern Germany was formed in 1871 when Otto von Bismarck unified most of the German states (with the notable exception of Austria) into the German Empire. The period of Nazi rule from the 1930s through the end of the Second World War brought significant territorial losses for the country. Nazi Germany initially expanded the country's territory dramatically and conquered most of Europe, though not all areas were added to Germany proper.
what does calcium do	Calcium is a mineral found in many foods. The body needs calcium to maintain strong bones and to carry out many important functions. Almost all calcium is stored in bones and teeth, where it supports their structure and hardness. The body also needs calcium for muscles to move and for nerves to carry messages between the brain and every body part. In addition, calcium is used to help blood vessels move blood throughout the body and to help release hormones and enzymes that affect almost every function in the human body. Calcium absorption is best when a person consumes no more than 500 mg at one time. So a person who takes 1,000 mg/day of calcium from supplements, for example, should split the dose rather than take it all at once. Calcium supplements may cause gas, bloating, and constipation in some people.1 Calcium citrate contains 21% elemental calcium. 2  This one has the advantage in that it can be taken with or without food, and is absorbed equally well. 3  It is useful for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, achlorhydria and some absorption disorders. It is found in many foods. We need to consume a certain amount of calcium to build and maintain strong bones and healthy communication between the brain and various parts of the body. The National Health Service (NHS) 1, UK, says there is more calcium in the human body than any other mineral.
what does Hipaa call institutions transmitting information electronically	Under the Standards for Electronic Transactions and the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information covered entities include health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a standard transaction. Subject to certain important exceptions (e.g., uses and disclosures for treatment, payment, or health care operations), the HIPAA regulations require covered entities to obtain a written authorization from individuals before using or disclosing the PHI of that individual.HIPAA’S Privacy Rule and Administration Simplification rules apply to all health care plans and providers who transmit health information in electronic form in connection with transactions for which the Secretary of HHS has adopted standards under HIPAA. The Privacy Rule protects all “individually identifiable health information” held or transmitted by a “covered entity” or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information “protected health information (PHI).”. “Individually identifiable health information” is information, including demographic data, that relates to: 1  the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, 2  the provision of health care to the individual, or
average cost for corporate tax return preparation	I just ran across a bit of interesting information on the cost of tax preparation from the National Society of Accountants. According to their biennial survey, the average tax prep fee for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A plus a state tax return is $229. For a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions, the average price drops to $129. Update: Be sure to check out this recent post from GetRichSlowly with tons of additional data on tax preparation costs for 2012. For those of us with more complex returns, here’s a rundown of average costs for other IRS tax forms: 1  $212 for Form 1040 Schedule C (profit or loss from business). 2  $551 for Form 1065 (partnership). 3  $692 for Form 1120 (corporation).Our fees are generally form-based. For example, if your tax return includes Form 1040, Schedule A, and Oregon Form 40, we would charge a fixed price for each these forms. For the 2015 filing season our fee for Form 1040 is $195, Schedule A is $56 and Oregon 40 is $45 for a total preparation fee of $296. Below is a table which outlines some of the most common tax return situations and our fees for preparing forms associated with these returns. Fees for preparing corporate and partnership returns vary according to the complexity of the tax return. The average fee ranges from $650 - $1,000 with some returns falling below or above these amounts.
how long does usf irb take	If you do not find the answer to your question below, please contact an IRB Coordinator. Getting Started with Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval. Q. What types of projects require IRB approval? In order for a project to require oversight by the IRB it must meet the regulatory definitions of research AND human subjects. Policy #3.001, “Investigational Activities Requiring IRB Review and Approval” defines activities that must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before the project begins (including recruitment).Recertification must take place every three years from the date of initial certification through the CITI Refresher Course or another USF IRB-approved program listed on the IRB website. In lieu of a CITI course, USF Undergraduate and Graduate students can choose to participate in one of the USF IRB's bi-annual Student Researcher Workshops, offered in the fall and spring semesters. This live workshop provides training and information regarding human subjects research, and fulfills the education requirement for three years. It is the responsibility of investigators and their staff to maintain current certification in human research protection education while engaged in human subjects research. 1  Education in human research protection is required for all faculty, staff and students directly involved in the conduct of research. This includes:
how much should it cost to replace a wheel bearing	Answers. Best Answer: Per MSN Autos An occasional problem on this vehicle is failure of either front Wheel Bearing and Hub Assembly. The cost to replace the Wheel Bearing and Hub Assembly on a 2 Wheel Drive (2WD) vehicle with independent suspension is $203.00 for parts and $59.00 for labor. The cost to replace the Wheel Bearing and Hub Assembly on a All Wheel Drive (AWD) vehicle with independent suspension is $284.00 for parts and $65.00 for labor. The cost to replace the Wheel Bearing and Hub Assembly on a vehicle without independent suspension is $293.00 for parts and $65.00 for labor. All prices are estimates based on $65.00 per flat rate hour and do not include diagnostic time or any applicable sales tax. Source(s): Google (got to love the facts).You can go to a shop and get a menu price bearing repack for $69.99. The bearings without mark up, run $24.99 each including the races. That $69.99 maintenance repack will be thrown in to combination labor now. The labor is $69.99 ($29.99 during a maintenance brake job). Since you have a 4x4, that adds 2.0 hours labor. Some shops have a menu price on 4x4 serviceable wheel bearing repacks. You will spend about $100.00 in parts after they are marked up, shop supplies etc, and then roughly you can count on 2 hours labor at the shop's hourly rate. I would tend to agree this will run about $300.00. Source(s):
what is lecithin for	Commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of phospholipids in oil. The lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. It is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. Lecithin, as a food additive, is also a dietary source of several active compounds: Choline and its metabolites are needed for several physiological purposes, including cell membrane signaling and cholinergic neurotransmission, and is a major source for methyl groups via its metabolite, trimethylglycine (betaine).Lecithin is a fat that is essential in the cells of the body. It can be found in many foods, including soybeans and egg yolks. Lecithin is taken as a medicine and is also used in the manufacturing of medicines. Lecithin is used for treating memory disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer ’s disease. It is also used for treating gallbladder disease, liver disease, certain types of depression, high cholesterol, anxiety, and a skin disease called eczema. Some people apply lecithin to the skin as a moisturizer. Lecithin is LIKELY SAFE for most people. It can cause some side effects including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, or fullness. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of lecithin during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use
what are some strengths of my genes	However, the truth is always complicated. It isn't so simple as if you have the gene for a disease, you will get the disease.. Here are some of the reasons why: 1  While genes play a role in many disorders, so do the conditions and circumstances of your life and the decisions you make. 2  In other words, heredity may influence your health, but so does your environment. 3  For example, some people have genes that put them at risk for cancer. 1 Only a few human diseases are triggered by a single gene working by itself. 2  In most cases, a disease results from the actions of many genes. 3  An example of a single-gene disorder is Huntington's disease, which was discussed in the last chapter. 4  One error in one gene leads to the fatal health problems of HD.Most of these traits and behaviors are inherited as complex conditions, meaning that multiple genes and environmental, behavioral, or nutritional factors may contribute to the phenotype. Currently, available tests include those for eye color, handedness, addictive behavior, nutritional background, and athleticism. This practice is defined as the nontherapeutic use of cells, genes, or genetic elements to enhance athletic performance. Gene doping takes advantage of cutting-edge research in gene therapy that involves the transfer of genetic material to human cells to treat or prevent disease (Well, 2008).
what are the three parts of the brain and their functions	The brain is made of three main parts: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain consists of the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus (part of the limbic system). The midbrain consists of the tectum and tegmentum. The hindbrain is made of the cerebellum, pons and medulla. Often the midbrain, pons, and medulla are referred to together as the brainstem. The Cerebrum: The cerebrum or cortex is the largest part of the human brain, associated with higher brain function such as thought and action. The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. The Cerebellum: The cerebellum, or little brain, is similar to the cerebrum in that it has two hemispheres and has a highly folded surface or cortex. This structure is associated with regulation and coordination of movement, posture, and balance.The brain is the most complex part of the human body. This three-pound organ is the seat of intelligence, interpreter of the senses, initiator of body movement, and controller of behavior. The hindbrain includes the upper part of the spinal cord, the brain stem, and a wrinkled ball of tissue called the cerebellum (1). The hindbrain controls the body’s vital functions such as respiration and heart rate. The cerebellum coordinates movement and is involved in learned rote movements.
what is a glomus tumor	Glomus Tumors (Tympanicum Jugulare). Glomus tumors are the most common benign tumors of the middle ear. They arise from glomus bodies. Glomus bodies are tiny, normal structures in the middle ear which serve as baro receptors. These baro receptors sense and help to regulate the oxygen pressure in the middle ear and mastoid. As glomus tumors expand, they begin to fill the middle ear. Some glomus tumors of the middle ear start by growing from the floor of the ear upward. These are the tumors difficult to distinguish from glomus jugulare tumors. A CT scan or other radiologic findings are needed in these cases.Glomus tumors — also known as paragangliomas — of the head and neck are benign (noncancerous) but locally invasive tumors that arise from glomus cells. In the head and neck, glomus tumor tissue is found in the jugular bulb, middle ear, and carotid artery. Of these sites, tumors are most common in the jugular bulb, which is a region of the jugular vein positioned immediately below the middle ear. These glomus tumors may grow into the middle ear and brain. Tumors originating in glomus cells of the middle ear are called glomus tympanicum tumors. Glomus tympanicum tumors are the most common tumors of the middle ear. Glomus tumors may also arise in deep neck (parapharyngeal) space along the course of the vagus nerve. These are called glomus vagale tumors
biffy clyro what does it mean	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Biffy Clyro are a Scottish rock band that formed in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, comprising Simon Neil (guitar, lead vocals), James Johnston (bass, vocals) and Ben Johnston (drums, vocals). 'Mon the Biffy! or, in more recent times, 'Mon the Biff!, are well known chants among Biffy fans, usually shouted in between songs at gigs, or before the band comes on stage. The band have never disclosed where the name 'Biffy Clyro' originated, giving a series of stories as to how the name came about.Johnston has been sober since and is now in recovery after attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. After years of refusing to explain the origin of their band name, Biffy Clyro finally spilled the beans in a 2010 interview with Spin magazine. Guitarist and lead vocalist Simon Neil said that Biffy Clyro is derived from the name of UK entertainer Cliff Richard. When he and Ben Johnston (drummer) were youths in the little Scottish town of Ayr they would dream up imaginary Cliff Richard merch products, like Cliff Richard coat hangers and Cliff Richard Biro pens. The band's sixth studio album, Opposites, will be released on 28th January 2013. The box set includes twenty songs spread across two CDs. Just in-Biffy Clyro drummer and vocalist Ben Johnston recently revealed that his drinking problem nearly derailed the success of the band.
how much does a pop-up trailer weigh	Pop up camper weight can vary greatly depending on what options you’re looking for in a camper and what your tow-vehicle can manage. Of course, the bigger your ride, the bigger your camper can be. But not everyone can afford a large tow-behind RV, or wants to experience the outdoors like that. Larger pop up campers that come with a kitchen sink can weigh well over a ton, while the most Spartan pop up camper weight is around 600 pounds empty. But GO isn’t just a camper—it’s a hauler. Its pop up camper weight is 840 pounds, yet can carry 800 pounds of cargo. That’s a couple dirt bikes, a mid-sized motorcycle, or full-sized adult ATV. Get a GO and get gone today.You want to be sure that you do not exceed the towing capacity of your vehicle. Jayco pop-up trailers start at the dry weight of 1,835 lb. with a hitch weight of 140 lb. and a capacity of 865 lb. This makes the trailer's total possible weight 2,250 lb. The largest of the Jayco pop-up trailers weighs 2,780 lb. with a hitch weight of 375 lb. and a capacity of 1,070 lb. This trailer's possible total weight is 3,850 lb. There are two other Jayco pop-up trailers with weights that fall between these two. Size of the Trailer. The smallest of the Jayco pop-up trailers is 13 feet 6 inches when it is closed up in its towing mode. When opened up at the campsite, this trailer measures 19 feet 6 inches long.
what is the poisonous effect of benzene	Eating or drinking foods containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting, irritation of the stomach, dizziness, sleepiness, convulsions, rapid heart rate, and death. The major effect of benzene from long-term exposure is on the blood. Benzene causes harmful effects on the bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells leading to anemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and can affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection. Benzene is also used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. Natural sources of benzene include emissions from volcanoes and forest fires. Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke.Workers in industries that make or use benzene may be exposed to high levels of this chemical. These include the rubber industry, oil refineries, chemical plants, shoe manufacturers, and gasoline-related industries. Benzene is also used to make some types of lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. Other people who may be exposed to benzene at work include steel workers, printers, lab technicians, gas station employees, and firefighters. Benzene is known to cause cancer, based on evidence from studies in both people and lab animals. The link between benzene and cancer has largely focused on leukemia and cancers of other blood cells.
monoclonal antibodies biology definition	Antibodies Defined. Antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system to help stop harm from occurring. They are also called immunoglobulins. When an intruder, such as a virus, bacteria, or other chemical, enters the body, the immune system springs into action.These invaders, antigens, are met by the B cells (a type of white blood cell from the immune system).These B cells will begin to create Y-shaped proteins called antibodies that begin the process to destroy the antigen and to protect the body from harm and infection.hese invaders, antigens, are met by the B cells (a type of white blood cell from the immune system). These B cells will begin to create Y-shaped proteins called antibodies that begin the process to destroy the antigen and to protect the body from harm and infection.Definition. Monoclonal antibodies are complex proteins derived from a single B cell made by the body's immunological defence system to recognise and fight foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses.Each monoclonal antibody is designed to recognise and bind to specific cell-surface receptors.onoclonal antibodies are made from natural antibodies made by the body to fight foreign invaders. Their production involves several steps. In the first instance a laboratory animal is injected with a desired target to stimulate their immune system to produce antibodies.
what is hibernating myocardium	In cardiology, hibernating myocardium is a state when some segments of the myocardium exhibit abnormalities of contractile function. These abnormalities can be visualised with echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), nuclear medicine (PET) or ventriculography. Echocardiography: A wall motion abnormality at rest which improves during a low-dose dobutamine stress test is classified as hibernating myocardium. Low dose dobutamine stimulates contractile function and thus helps to predict functional recovery after revascularization. This is probably the most accurate way to visualise scarred myocardium. An alternative (or additional) technique with CMR is the use of low dose dobutamine similar to echocardiography. PET: The finding of a perfusion or metabolic mismatch between PET-FDG and PET-NH 3 is indicative of decreased metabolism.1 hibernating myocardium typically represents a chronic process whereas stunned myocardium is typically related to an acute infarction or ischaemic insult resulting in altered wall motion. 2  repetitive stunning may evolve into hibernating myocardium. 1 differentiation from stunned myocardium can be difficult, but can sometimes be made on the basis of maintained, or nearly maintained, perfusion with a wall motion abnormality (hibernating myocardium will have abnormal perfusion and a wall motion abnormality).
what key considerations to take when reviewing RFP documents	Once this is done, the RFP should be issued to all those who have indicated interest in responding. D. Responding to the RFP Allow the consultant sufficient time to respond to the RFP. The length of time can vary depending on the nature of the proposal. On average, three weeks is enough time to respond to an RFP. • Deadlines for receipt of proposals. B. Specific RFP Format When sending the RFP to the consultant, the following must be included: • Title Sheet:The title sheet should include the client's name, an indication of what the RFP will be used for and the deadline for submitting responses.It should be used for high value sourcing projects with a medium to long time frame, the impact on the organization is moderate to high and the types of possible solutions are many and varied. In an RFP review we should see five key sections. These are. Introduction. This first section must be used to introduce your Company and your industry and provide details of the reason for the Request for Proposal. You need to state what you hope to achieve by this process and approximately, by when. When doing an RFP review these five elements need to be covered, not in any particular order. Preparation is key to a successful RFP, short cuts will provide poor and fewer responses and the process may have to be repeated. Return from RFP Review to Choosing RFI, RFP, or RFQ
how does hypoxia affect the body	Hypoxia (also known as hypoxiation or anoxemia) is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. Hypoxia may be classified as either generalized, affecting the whole body, or local, affecting a region of the body. Hypoxia differs from hypoxemia in that hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is insufficient, whereas hypoxemia refers specifically to states that have low arterial oxygen supply. Hypoxia in which there is complete deprivation of oxygen supply is referred to as anoxiaHypobaric Hypoxia. Hypobaric hypoxia is a condition where the body is deprived of a sufficient supply of oxygen from the air to supply for body tissues whether in quantity or molecular concentration. Hypoxic hypoxia affects the body’s ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream. Oxygen is the main component required to maintain our body functions because it is involved in the oxidation of complex chemical food-stuff to produce energy for our other biological processes that happen inside our body. Hypoxic hypoxia therefore does not mean that erythrocytes are not enough to carry oxygen around from the alveoli of the lungs to the body tissues but simply the oxygen molecule that is to be carried is insufficient. This condition is particularly more likely to happen when a person ascends to a higher altitude.
average teacher salary in detroit	New data released by the Michigan Department of Education shows that the average public school teacher salary in Michigan increased slightly for the 2011-2012 school year to $62,631. T hese figures include both conventional school districts and public charter schools, but the difference between these two types of schools was large, according to the data. The average salary for charter school teachers was $42,864, [1] while the average for just conventional school teachers was $63,094. Below are the 20 districts (with more than 100 pupils) that had the highest average teacher salaries in the state: [1] This figure is made of data from only about 15 percent of charter schoolsPoor bankrupt Detroit pays teachers more than San Fran and NYC, cities that have actual money. The average teacher's salary in Detroit is $71,031. But there's a problem. Detroit has more teachers than students. The Detroit Public Schools could be faced with a staffing dilemma in a couple of years if steps are not taken to reduce the number of teachers employed by the district. In 2002 just as in 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Education, only 32 percent of Michigan public-school eighth graders scored proficient or better in reading. But this would change if only we truly paid teachers as much as we pay NBA basketball stars. The average Michigan teacher salary is $63,000.
how do hearing aids cost	According to a survey recently published by the Hearing Review, the average price of a mid-level pair of aids hovers between $4,400 and $4,500. Prices vary by region. At UCLA's Audiology Clinic, for example, the average price is $4,200, says audiologist Alison Grimes.

how to set up derailleur gears	Shift your front derailleur into the middle or smallest ring, then wind your rear barrel adjuster in fully clockwise, then out one turn. Release the cable mounting bolt on the back of the derailleur. Step 2. Pedal gently, and push the derailleur until the chain moves up to the second-smallest cog, then stop pedaling. Shift the front gears to the smallest ring, and the back gears to the largest cog. Fully wind in the low adjust screw. You should complete this procedure with a slack gear cable, so you can be sure that cable tension isn’t overriding your low limit setting. To do this, release the cable retention bolt on the derailleurStep 2: Turn the front derailleur barrel adjuster all the way clockwise to release any tension that may be in the cable. Step 3: To set your inner limit, first shift your front derailleur into the small chain ring and your rear derailleur into the largest cog. You want to turn the inner limit screw until the inner part of the derailleur cage is as close as possible to the chain without rubbing. Step 4: Tighten your cable tension by loosening the cable anchor, pulling the cable tight and then retightening the cable anchor. Step 5: To set your outer limit, first shift your front derailleur into the large chain ring in the front and your rear derailleur to the smallest cog. You want to turn the outer limit screw until the out

what does the governor general canada do	The Queen or sovereign is the head of state in Canada. The Governor General of Canada represents the sovereign, and most of the powers and authority of the sovereign have been delegated to the Governor General. The role of the Canadian Governor General is mostly symbolic and ceremonial. The head of government in Canada is the Prime Minister, an elected political leader. The Canadian Governor General plays a strong role in encouraging excellence in Canada through a system of honours and awards such as the Order of Canada and promotes national identity and national unity. The Governor General of Canada is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces.The Governor General acts as the Queen's representative in Canada and Canada's de facto head of state. (The Queen is the official head of state.). Before 1926, the Governor General acted as the representative of the British government in Canada. Until the 1950s, the Governor General was always British. Since then, the post has alternated between an English-Canadian and a French-Canadian. When Byng turned him down, Mackenzie King resigned and the Governor General invited Conservative Arthur Meighen to form a government. Mackenzie King soon returned to power with a majority government, but the  King-Byng Affair  led to reforms of the Governor General's role in Canada and throughout the dominions.
what is cyclodextrin technology	Cyclodextrins are produced from starch by means of enzymatic conversion. They are used in food, pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and chemical industries, as well as agriculture and environmental engineering. amylose (a fragment of starch). The 5-membered macrocycle is not natural. Recently, the largest well-characterized cyclodextrin contains 32 1,4-anhydroglucopyranoside units, while as a poorly characterized mixture, at least 150-membered cyclic oligosaccharides are also known. In 2013, α-cyclodextrin is found to be able to selectively form second-sphere coordination complex with tetrabromoaurate anion ([AuBr4]-) from transition-metal anion mixtures, and thus is used to selectively recover gold from various gold-bearing materials in an environmentally benign manner.20, 1989. In the '679 patent a beta cyclodextrin complexant is used to separate the branched from the non-branched beta cyclodextrin. However, such a process requires the further processing of the complexed non-branched beta cyclodextrin to separate the complexant from the non-branched cyclodextrin. There is a need for a simple, inexpensive method for purifying non-branched beta cyclodextrin to remove the branched cyclodextrin. Crystallization is a known technique for industrial purification of materials. Crystallization is, in essence, the precipitation of solid materials from solution.
what is the best temperature to make yeast rise	130° F140° F (55° C60° C) Yeast cells die (thermal death point). 120° F130° F (49° C55° C) Water temperature for activating yeast designed to be mixed with the dry ingredients in a recipe. 105° F115° F (41° C46° C) Temperature of water for dry yeast reconstituted with water and sugar. 100° F (38° C) or lower When yeast is mixed with water at too low a temperature, an amino acid called glutathione leaks from the cell walls, making doughs sticky and hard to handle. 80° F90° F (27° C32° C) Optimum temperature range for yeast to grow and reproduce at dough fermentation stage. 70° F80° F (21° C27°C) Recommended water temperature for bread machines. 40° F (4° C) Recommended refrigerator temperature. Used directly from the fridge, yeast is too cold to work properly• Keep Rising Dough Warm: Yeast works best at temperatures between 70°F and 80°F. If your house is cool in the winter, place the bowl somewhere warmer, like the top of a fridge or in a warm (but turned off!) oven. If you put the dough on a heater to rise, insulate the bottom of the bowl with a few fluffy towels. Active dry yeast and instant (or rapid-rise) yeast are the two most common yeasts available to us as home bakers. The two yeasts can be used interchangeably in recipes, but active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water before using while instant yeast can be mixed right into the dough.
how long to hatch a chicken egg	If for some reason the temperature has dropped below the correct temperature on a few occasions, you could find some of your eggs only hatching on day 22, 23, or even on day 24 or 25. Whereas fertilized chicken eggs usually take exactly 21 days to hatch, most duck eggs take 28 days, apart from Muscovy ducks. As a general rule of thumb, the eggs of Muscovy ducks take 35 days, but once again, it can vary slightly depending on conditions. The answer to that is 21 days exactly, although you need to bear in mind that this can vary, depending on a number of circumstances. Generally speaking however, fertile chicken eggs which are hatched out by a hen will take 21 days before you see little faces staring at you from underneath their mamma's wings.With optimum conditions such as temperature and humidity a chicken egg takes 21 days to hatch.    From when it was layed, about 20-28 days,depending on the breed. From th … e time when the egg first cracked, about one day. This is a very slow process. Chicken eggs take exactly 21 days from the date they are started incubating. Hatched naturally, most broody hens will take about 6 days to gather enough eggs and then set the nest. For the next 21 days she will seldom leave the nest except for defecating and occasionally for food and water. She will not allow the eggs to drop more than a degree or two in temperature
how did the american flag come to be	The American flag has been around for over two hundred years. The first flag to be used by Washington was on New year's Day, 1776 when he ordered the Grand Union flag to be hoisted above his place on Prospect Hill during the siege over the British Army in Boston. It had thirteen alternating red and white stripes with the British Union Jack in the upper left hand corner. This was the start of many US flags to be hoisted as the American Flag. Soon after that in May, Betsy Ross claimed to have sewn the first US flag. Today our flag has thirteen stripes representing the original thirteen colonies with seven red stripes and six white. It has 50 stars representing all of our states on the blue background in the upper left hand corner. The American Flag can be seen in just about every person's home or belongings in this country.Every country has its own myths and legends. In America, we have many. For example, George Washington cutting down a cherry tree as a boy and when asked about this transgression stating that 'I cannot tell a lie.. Another cherished myth related to the history of the American flag deals with one Betsy Ross. 1 To view the specifications of the present American flag, please view this page. 2  January 3, 1959 - An Executive Order from President Dwight Eisenhower stated that the stars would be arranged in seven rows of seven stars each.
what is acetone precipitation wiki	This is about the chemical compound. For the band, see Acetone (band). Acetone (systematically named propanone) is the organic compound with the formula (CH 3) 2 CO. It is a colorless, volatile, flammable liquid, and is the simplest ketone. Acetone is miscible with water and serves as an important solvent in its own right, typically for cleaning purposes in the laboratory. About 6.7 million tonnes were produced worldwide in 2010, mainly for use as a solvent and production of methyl methacrylate and bisphenol A. In the laboratory, acetone is used as a polar, aprotic solvent in a variety of organic reactions, such as SN2 reactions. The use of acetone solvent is critical for the Jones oxidation. It does not form an azeotrope with water (see azeotrope (data)).This is commonly achieved by adding a water-soluble solvent such as acetone to an aqueous solution of protein. Acetone had the advantage that it is relatively inexpensive and is available in in a pure form with few contaminants that may inhibit or poison the enzyme. It is also frequently used in sterol extraction. In practice, it is routinely carried out at a temperature below 0ºC. Questions Calculate the volume fraction of acetone at the onset of precipitation for each protein solution. Calculate the protein yield for each case by following the same procedure as in ammonium sulfate precipitation.
which term means hardened artery	Split and merge into it. Answer by Digitalis. Confidence votes 6.9K. Hardening of the arteries due to cholesterol plaques is called atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis. The term Atherosclerosis literally means hardening from atheroma . In a healthy person, the artiers have walls that are muscular, smooth and elastic enough to allow for variations in blood pressure, which allows the blood to pass through freely. Arteriorrhaphy is the medical term for suture of an artery. This is  when a surgeon will close up an artery. If an artery was severed,  they would reattach both sides of the … blood vessel walls, like  stitching up a deep cut. A related term, angiorrhaphy, means suture  of any vessel.Atherosclerosis is the build up of a waxy plaque on the inside of blood vessels. In Greek, athere means gruel, and skleros means hard. Atherosclerosis is often called arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the Greek arteria, meaning artery) is a general term for hardening of the arteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in several forms, including atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis that affects only the inner lining of an artery. It is characterized by plaque deposits that block the flow of blood. Plaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol, waste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, a stringy material that helps clot blood.
which describes the cells of a wilted plant	Plant cells have certain distinguishing features, including chloroplasts, cell walls, and intracellular vacuoles. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts; cell walls allow plants to have strong, upright structures; and vacuoles help regulate how cells handle water and storage of other molecules. Besides the presence of chloroplasts, another major difference between plant and animal cells is the presence of a cell wall. The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane of plant cells and provides tensile strength and protection against mechanical and osmotic stress. It also allows cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the pressure of the cell contents against the cell wallThe membrane surrounding a vacuole is called tonoplast. A mature plant cell has a single vacuole at the near center of the cell (central vacuole), which contributes to about 30-80 percent of the cell's volume. Cytoplasm Cytoplasm is filled up by cytosol, which is a gelatinous and semitransparent fluid. All the organelles of plant cell are present in this cytoplasm. This part of the plant cell is the site for cell division, glycolysis and many other cellular activities. If the plant is watered with fresh water, the osmotic potential would cause water to move into the cells of the plant because the concentration of water outside is greater tha … n the concentration of water inside.
in what food protein is found	Complete proteins, which come from animal sources such as chicken, fish, dairy and soybeans, contain all the essential amino acids that help build your muscle and body tissue. Incomplete proteins, found in plant foods, such as grains, seeds, nuts, beans and vegetables, provide a varying but limited array of amino acids. A greater variety and amount of incomplete proteins must be consumed to cover all the amino acids needed for protein building. Proteins are the building blocks that grow and repair your body. Proteins are needed not only for muscle but also for hair, skin and internal organs. Some proteins travel around your body in the blood as hormones, enzymes and red blood cells. Protein is unique because it is the only food source of nitrogen, which is essential to all plant and animal life. Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids. For each protein, there are specific amino acids in a specific amount, and they are joined in a unique orderFor food products made from gluten, see Wheat gluten (food) . Sources of gluten: Clockwise from top: high-gluten wheat flour, European spelt, barley, rolled rye flakes. Gluten (from Latin gluten,  glue ) is a protein composite found in wheat and related grains, including barley and rye. Gluten gives elasticity to dough, helping it rise and keep its shape and often gives the final product a chewy texture. 
what are the primary host cells for hiv	HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4 + T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4 + T cells), macrophages, and dendriticOnce in DNA form, the genetic information of HIV is incorporated as a provirus with the host cell DNA. The proviral genome can subsequently be transcribed into viral RNA that functions as mRNA for translation into HIV proteins and as genomes for the subsequent generation of the virus. Entry of HIV into a host cell is also thought to involve a co-receptor on the cell surface, either CCR5 or CXCR4, which typically function as receptors of chemokines. The HIV virus envelope is a derivative of the plasma membrane of a host cell, obtained via budding. When HIV attempts to enter a cell, interactions between cell surface molecules and viral envelope proteins allow the envelope to fuse with the cell membrane

The loss of living heart muscle as a result of coronary artery occlusion. MI or its related syndromes (acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina) usually occurs when an atheromatous plaque in a coronary artery ruptures, and the resulting clot obstructs the injured blood vessel. 2. an infarct. cardiac infarction. see myocardial infarction (below) and also myocardial infarction. cerebral infarction. an ischemic condition of the brain, causing a persistent focal neurological(June 2011). Infarction is tissue death (necrosis) caused by a local lack of oxygen, due to an obstruction of the tissue's blood supply. The resulting lesion is referred to as an infarct (from the Latin infarctus, stuffed into). Myocardial infarction is the partial death of heart tissue commonly known as heart attack. 1 Brain: Cerebral infarction is the ischemic kind of stroke due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. 2  It can be atherothrombotic or embolic. 3  Stroke caused by cerebral infarction should be distinguished from two other kinds of stroke: cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
what does caco mean	Top Definition. caco. A caco is pretty much the Puerto Rican cousin of the British townie / chav or the North American wanksta / wigger. Their name comes from the greek cacos meaning bad or low quality(Example: cacophony) and was a term in used in Spain referring to a low-life.

As a result, over the years the characteristics of the cells used in different laboratories around the world have diverged significantly, which makes it difficult to compare results across labs. Caco-2 cells are most commonly used not as individual cells, but as a confluent monolayer on a cell culture insert filter. When cultured in this format, the cells differentiate to form a polarized epithelial cell monolayer that provides a physical and biochemical barrier to the passage of ions and small molecules
what is the features of sandstone	Sandstone Basics. Sandstone is a category of rock made from sediment (a sedimentary rock). The sediment particles are clasts, or pieces, of minerals and fragments of rock, thus sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock. Sandstone has two different kinds of material in it besides the sediment particles: matrix and cement. Matrix is the fine-grained stuff (silt and clay size) that was in the sediment along with the sand whereas cement is the mineral matter, introduced later, that binds the sediment into rock.Sandstone (sometimes known as arenite) is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized minerals or rock grains. Most sandstone is composed of quartz and/or feldspar because these are the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. Like sand, sandstone may be any color, but the most common colors are: tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions. Cement is a secondary mineral that forms after deposition and during burial of the sandstone. These cementing materials may be either silicate minerals or non-silicate minerals, such as calcite. 1  Silica cement can consist of either quartz or opal minerals. 2  Quartz is the most common silicate mineral that acts as cement.
where do bullet ants come from	Paraponera clavata is a species of ant, commonly known as the bullet ant, named on account of its powerful and potent sting due to its venom.It inhabits humid lowland rainforests from Nicaragua and the extreme east of Honduras south to Paraguay.It is also known as the lesser giant hunting ant and conga ant.hese ants are found in Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica from the north, and in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil from the south. Colonies are found in lowland areas, at elevations ranging from sea level to 750 metres (2,460 ft).Bullet ants are used to seal wounds. The ants have strong mandibles, or jaws are placed over an open wound. The ant's mandibles seal the wound tightly, and the saliva of the bullet ant provides an extra layer of protection for the wound. The good news is that bullet ants do not live in North America.However, you may encounter some when visiting a zoo or when traveling abroad, especially to Central or South America. In the off chance you experience a bullet ant sting, have someone take you to the emergency room immediately.he bullet ant likes to nest at the bases of trees. It is also known as the 24-hour ant because the pain from the sting is said to last 24 hours. This scary critter derives its name from its sting, which has been proven to be. the most painful sting out of all the invertebrates in the world.
how to put yourself to sleep	Lie directly on your back in a straight position and place your arms alongside your body so that the blood can flow freely. Then place your legs in a straight position to get rid of all the possible kinks and bends in all other parts of the body.

does diphtheria toxoid vaccine include tetanus	Single-antigen diphtheria toxoid is not available. Diphtheria toxoid is combined with tetanus toxoid as pediatric diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (DT) or adult tetanus-diphtheria (Td), and with both tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine as DTaP and Tdap. Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The name of the disease is derived from the Greek diphthera, meaning leather hide. The disease was described in the 5th century BCE by Hippocrates, and epidemics were described in the 6th century AD by Aetius.The tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines are given to children together as a combination vaccine called Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis). Children should get a total of 5 doses of Tdap vaccines before they reach 6 years of age. The tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td), given together as a single vaccine, is intended for children ages 7 and older and for adults. It does not contain the pertussis vaccine and has less diphtheria toxoid than the DTaP vaccine. Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis are serious diseases. Tetanus (also called lockjaw) is caused by bacteria usually found in soil, dust, and manure. Unlike other diseases for which people receive vaccines, tetanus is not contagious (it is not spread from person to person). A person gets tetanus from the environment
yearly cost to raise a child	The average cost of raising a child born in 2013 up until age 18 for a middle-income family in the U.S. is approximately $245,340 (or $304,480, adjusted for projected inflation), according to the latest annual Cost of Raising A Child report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The estimate is 1.8 percent higher than the previous year. That equates to roughly $12,800 - $14,970 per child per year for a two-parent family with a median annual income between $61,530 and $106,540. The annual cost can vary based on factors like the child's age, the number of children in the family and the family's income and locationFrom day care to the monthly grocery bill, the cost of raising a child is climbing at a rate that many families can't keep up with. It will cost an estimated $241,080 for a middle-income couple to raise a child born last year for 18 years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday. That's up almost 3% from 2011 and doesn't even include the cost of college. At the same time, wages aren't keeping up. In 2011, the average cost of full-time center-based care for an infant ranged from about $4,600 a year in Mississippi to more than $15,000 in Massachusetts. Related: 'How we afford our kids'. Many families are priced out of licensed child care services, said Lynette Fraga, executive director of the nonprofit group.
what kind of play did thespis performed	By the time of Sophocles' death in 406 BC, 128 years after Thespis' victory in the first Athenian drama competition, the golden era of Greek drama was waning. Athens, whose freethinking culture had spawned the birth of theatre, would be overrun in 404 BC by the Spartans. He added a second actor (the antagonist) to interact with the first. Heintroduced props and scenery and reduced the chorus from 50 to 12. Aeschylus' Persians, written in 472 BC, is the earliest play in existence. Aeschylus' crowning work was The Oresteia, a trilogy of tragedies first performed in 458 BC.Thespis was a singer of dithyrambs (songs about stories from mythology with choric refrains). He is credited with introducing a new style in which one singer or actor performed the words of individual characters in the stories, distinguishing between the characters with the aid of different masks. This new style was called tragedy, and Thespis was the most popular exponent of it. Eventually, in 534 BC competitions to find the best tragedy were instituted at the City Dionysia in Athens, and Thespis won the first documented competition. It is implied that Thespis invented acting in the Western world, and that prior to his performances, no one had ever assumed the resemblance of another person for the purpose of storytelling. In fact, Thespis is the first known actor in written plays.
what age can you get the age pension in australia	Age Pension age. Age Pension age is the age at which an Australian can claim the Age Pension. Australians retiring today can access the Age Pension at age 65 (for men) and since July 2013, from age 65 for women. The Age Pension age for women used to be 60 years but has steadily increased to 65 years, in line with the Age Pension age for men. For anyone born after June 1952, your Age Pension age will be older than 65 years. (The Age Pension age will remain at 65 for anyone born before July 1952.) If you were born after June 1952, then your Age Pension age depends on your specific date of birth.As people get closer to retirement they tend to change funds to be sure of a safer investment. Workers are able to add to these funds as they choose. The age pension is paid out at the age of 65 and in order to qualify you must have been a resident of Australia or a citizen of the country for a minimum of 10 years. The age pension is worth around $17,500 for a single person, although this rises to more than $26,000 for couples. This is reviewed annually.

what would be two examples of autotrophs in our habitat	1 Upload failed. 2  We are experiencing some problems, please try again. 3  You can only upload files of type PNG, JPG, or JPEG. 4  You can only upload files of type 3GP, 3GPP, MP4, MOV, AVI, MPG, MPEG, or RM. 5  You can only upload photos smaller than 5 MB. 6  You can only upload videos smaller than 600MB.An autotroph or producer, is an organism that produces complex organic compounds from simple substances present in its surroundings, generally using energy from light or inorganic chemical reactions. They are the producers in a food chain, such as plants on land or algae in water. They do not need a living source of energy or organic carbon. Autotrophs can reduce carbon dioxide to make organic compounds for biosynthesis and also create a store of chemical energy. Most autotrophs use water as the reducing agent, but some can use other hydrogen compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. Some autotrophs, such as green plants and algae, are phototrophs, meaning that they convert electromagnetic energy from sunlight into chemical energy in the form of reduced carbon. Autotrophs can be photoautotrophs or chemoautotrophs. Phototrophs use light as an energy source, while chemotrophs use electron donors as a source of energy, whether from organic or inorganic sources; however in the case of autotrophs, these electron donors come from inorganic chemical sources.

what are the lynphona stages	Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Stages. Staging is the process of finding out how far lymphoma has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body. This is very important because your treatment and prognosis (the outlook for your recovery) depend in large part on the stage of your cancer.on-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are considered to be at one of four stages. 1  Stage I: The lymphoma is in only one lymph-node area or one organ. 2  Stage II: The lymphoma is in two or more lymph-node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that separates the chest from the abdomen).Staging is important because your doctor uses the stage to work out the treatment you will need. The stage refers to the number of lymph nodes containing lymphoma cells and their position in the body. There are 4 stages of non Hodgkin lymphoma.Below is a simplified version of the staging system. 1  Stage 1 – you have lymphoma in one group of lymph nodes or in just one organ or area of the body. 2  Stage 2 – you have lymphoma in 2 or more groups of lymph nodes.he stage refers to the number of lymph nodes containing lymphoma cells and their position in the body.

what is the use of lentils	Lentils. When I am giving lectures I love to talk about lentils. Legumes are one of my favorite ingredients and lentils are one of my favorite legumes. They keep well in the cupboard, cook quickly and there are dozens of ways to use them-in soups, salads, stews, chili or simply as a side dish. Lentils, like peas, garbanzos and peanuts, are legumes. You can think of them as a starch since they are mostly carbohydrate and protein with essentially no fat. They best part is that they contain tons of fiber with a half cup of cooked lentils coming in at around 8 grams. The small dark green lentil is also known as the French lentil. You might find them labeled Puy lentils or by the French term lentilles vertes du Puy.. They have a thin shell and a stronger pea-like flavor. These are slightly tough and take longer to cook.Lentils are also commonly used in Ethiopia in a stew-like dish called kik, or kik wot, one of the dishes people eat with Ethiopia's national food, injera flat bread. Yellow lentils are used to make a non-spicy stew, which is one of the first solid foods Ethiopian women feed their babies. Red (or pink) lentils contain a lower concentration of fiber than green lentils (11% versus 31%). The low levels of readily digestible starch (5%), and high levels of slowly digested starch (30%), make lentils of potential value to people with diabetes.
do minerals contain fossils	Fossils are generally found in sedimentary rock. This occurs because the remains of plants and animals tend to accumulate with the inorganic debris that form such rock. In rare instances, fossils can form in igneous rock, as when volcanic ash or lava congeals around a leaf or insect wing, or fills a footprint. Exposed rock is the collector's fruitful ground. Many interesting minerals and fossils can be found on weathered slopes, riverbanks, and cliff faces. Human-made excavations such as road cuts and construction or quarry sites can be excellent sites for mineral hunting.This is necessary for the rock to even be considered an iron-rich sedimentary rock. Generally, they are from the Phanerozoic which means that they range in age from the present to 540 million years ago. They can contain iron minerals from the following groups: oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Some examples of minerals in iron-rich rocks containing oxides are limonite, hematite, and magnetite. Iron-rich sedimentary rocks are sedimentary rocks which contain 15% or more iron. However, most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees. The majority of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3800 to 570 million years ago), the early Paleozoic (570 to 410 million years ago), and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago)
what is the proper height to install a microwave	From contributor B: The bottom of the upper cabinets is a standard 54. Add the height of your microwave to determine the bottom of the cabinet over the microwave. This will put the bottom of your microwave at the 54 mark. 16-19 is the going height nowadays for modern microwaves, with 17 being the most common size. The standard top of the wall cabinet is 84 from the high point of the floor so all your wall cabinets are lined up at the top. If for example, your microwave is 16 height you can go with either a 12 or 15 wall cabinet above it.Microwave Clearance Rules. The most convenient location to place a microwave is 3 inches below your shoulder, though above-range microwaves may be higher. A microwave should be no more than 54 inches, and no less than 15 inches, from the floor, according to standards set by the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Distance From Stove Top. Microwave ovens vary in their materials and construction, so the minimum required distance from the stove top to the unit is based on manufacturer guidelines. Review installation instructions for your specific model. For many models, the bottom should be at least 15 inches above the stove top. Over-the-range microwaves may have set requirements about the distance between the stove top and the cabinetry about the microwave. In some cases this is 30 inches for a 16-inch microwave

how to adjust vertical blinds	You will need to make marks on two things. One is your door/window frame or ceiling and the other is the valance. For marks on your door/window frame or ceiling, hold your valance up, centered over door or window and mark the width of your valance (Width Mark). To remove blind, release headrail by inserting a screwdriver between headrail and release tab. Outside Mount Mounted on a Vertical Surface (Wall, Window or Door Frame) Mark  Height  on wall at Louver Length + 2. Center headrail over window at Height mark.During the life of your vertical blinds, if you find that the blinds are becoming increasingly difficult to function and operate, you can simply adjust the vertical blind chain to solve the problem. First, remove the end cap from the head rail. This can be accomplished with the use of a flathead screwdriver. Once you have found the pulley, tap lightly on the end of the rod to loosen the pulley. In order to loosen the vertical blind chain, find the vane carrier that is located within the head rail. Pull on the vane carrier firmly, and pull the extra cord with your free hand. This will adjust the length of the vertical blind chain. Once you have pulled it to the desired length, tie a knot in the cord. By tying the knot, the length of the cord will stay in the position that you desire. Then simply replace the end camp and you are ready to go!
what is muscadet wine	Muscadet Sevre-et-Maine Wine. Muscadet Sevre-et-Maine is the best known of the Muscadet appellations of the Loire Valley's Pays Nantais district, on the central western coast of France. The title covers exclusively white wines from vineyards around the Sevre and Maine rivers – minor tributaries of the Loire which converge just outside Nantes. About 80% of all Muscadet wine is made here, as the terroir is ideally suited to its production. A combination of volcanic, metamorphic and alluvial soils has led to an abundance of potassium, magnesium and calcium, providing the vines with the minerals they require for optimal growth.Muscadet is a white French wine. It is made at the western end of the Loire Valley, near the city of Nantes in the Pays de la Loire region neighboring the Brittany Region. More Muscadet is produced than any other Loire wine. It is made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape, often referred to simply as melon. As a rule in France, Appellation d'origine controlee contrôlée wines are named either after their growing region or after their (variety the latter In alsace). only (In contrast, the Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire AOC only produces around 20% of the amount of wine of Muscadet-Sevre sèvre Et) Maine in, fact MORE Aoc-Muscadet sevre Sèvre et maine is produced on a yearly basis than in any OTHER single aoc in The Entire. loire valley
types of chemical bonding	a chemical bond. The two extreme cases of chemical bonds are: Covalent bond: bond in which one or more pairs of electrons are shared by two atoms. Ionic bond: bond in which one or more electrons from one atom are removed and attached to another atom, resulting in positive and negative ions which attract each other. Other types of bonds include metallic bonds and hydrogen bonding. Chemical Bonding. Chemical compounds are formed by the joining of two or more atoms. A stable compound occurs when the total energy of the combination has lower energy than the separated atoms.Now let’s take a look at how these atoms and molecules hold together. Bonds hold atoms and molecules of substances together. There are several different kinds of bonds; the type of bond seen in elements and compounds depends on the chemical properties as well as the attractive forces governing the atoms and molecules. The three types of chemical bonds are Ionic bonds, Covalent bonds, and Polar covalent bonds. Chemists also recognize hydrogen bonds as a fourth form of chemical bond, though their properties align closely with the other types of bonds. Not all atoms bond the same way, so we need to learn the different types of bonds that atoms can form. There are three (sometimes four) recognized chemical bonds; they are ionic, covalent, polar covalent, and (sometimes) hydrogen bonds.

what is glucosamine sulfate used for	Glucosamine sulfate is a chemical found in the human body. It is used by the body to produce a variety of other chemicals that are involved in building tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the thick fluid that surrounds joints. Joints are cushioned by the fluid and cartilage that surround them. Some researchers think the “sulfate” part of glucosamine sulfate is also important. Sulfate is needed by the body to produce cartilage. This is one reason why researchers believe that glucosamine sulfate might work better than other forms of glucosamine such as glucosamine hydrochloride or N-acetyl glucosamine.Glucosamine is a naturally occurring substance found in the fluid around our joints. It is naturally present in animal bones, bone marrow, shellfish and fungi. Glucosamine plays a vital role in building cartilage and is commonly consumed as a supplement by people with arthritis, especially osteoarthritis. Glucosamine, especially glucosamine sulfate, is harvested from the shells of shellfish and put into dietary supplements. It can also be made in the laboratory. Glucosamine in supplements either comes from shellfish or is made in the laboratory. Although similar, the three forms may not have the same effect when used as dietary supplements. Most studies that have examined the potential health benefits of glucosamine have focused on glucosamine sulfate.

purpose of Pyridoxine hydrochloride in food	Dietary supplements. Vitamin B6 is available in multivitamins, in supplements containing other B complex vitamins, and as a stand-alone supplement [ 6 ]. The most common vitamin B6 vitamer in supplements is pyridoxine (in the form of pyridoxine hydrochloride [HCl]), although some supplements contain PLP. Vitamin B6 supplements are available in oral capsules or tablets (including sublingual and chewable tablets) and liquids. Food. Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of foods [ 1, 3, 4 ]. The richest sources of vitamin B6 include fish, beef liver and other organ meats, potatoes and other starchy vegetables, and fruit (other than citrus).Excessive consumption of pyridoxine hydrochloride supplements can cause neurological problems. Pyridoxine hydrochloride, or vitamin B6, is a member of the B complex family. This vitamin is found in high quantities in foods such as bananas, sardines, chicken spinach and avocados, according to the website dietbites.com. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is necessary for proper nerve function and for metabolizing nutrients. Excessive intake of pyridoxine hydrochloride can occur from overuse of vitamin supplements. At levels of 500 mg per day, and in some rare cases less than 500 mg per day, sensory neuropathy in the arms and legs has been observed, according to the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements.

weight loss and alcohol abstinence	Now you are only travelling 1 km every hour. It’s so slow, you may be tempted to throw in the towel! For this member, the lesson she learned was absolutely clear. If she drinks (alcohol) her weight goes up for a few days and it takes the rest of the week to get her weight loss back on track. Now this article is NOT about any moral, legal or health issues to do with drinking. But when it comes to weight loss, sometimes we have to be careful of our self talk. When alcohol was consumed (mainly on weekends) the weight loss did not just stop, but weight increased. The net effect is that her weight loss journey is far slower and longer than it would be if she abstained. We’ve seen many cases where alcohol stopped all weight loss.Lesson #6 – Alcohol is the epicenter of why you’ve put weight on. They say that losing weight is 80% diet and 20% exercise. I never believed this and over the years, have always tried to lose weight from hardcore exercise. However, it was only when I gave up booze that I really understood that the 80/20 thing is true. For me however, I was having a beer or two every night at home when I got in from work. This was part of my routine and the idea of that routine being broken was very scary, it was a crutch that I needed. However, once I’d found the motivation to lose weight by giving up alcohol, I was able to overcome that fear.
what mythology do unicorns come from	The truth is, unlike almost every single other mythical creature, the unicorn does not appear anywhere in any culture's actual mythology. That is to say, plenty of Greek scholars believed that unicorns existed, but the unicorn itself does not come from Greek mythology. There are no tales of gods riding unicorns or legends of unicorns fighting monsters. To put it simply, there is no such thing as 'unicorn mythology'. Greek scholars actually believed that this creature was real, and that it made its home in India. At the time, India was a little known distant land that seemed magical and mysterious to the ancient Greeks and Romans. It's interesting because the myth of the existence of unicorns is so widespread, that even if we assume that the carvings explain where unicorn myths came from, it still doesn't explain why they continued for so long. Notice that I haven't even described what a unicorn is.There is a lot of debate about the reality of the elusive unicorn & there are a lot of believers out there. This is an elusive creature said to possess great powers and pureness, & interestingly enough they have a presence in the mythology of many independent cultures around the world. The white horse we think of as a unicorn today is not necessarily the same animal that emerged from Chinese folklore where stories of its existence began 5000 years ago.
what are chromosomes mostly made up of	Chromosomes are made up mostly of DNA and are the structures in each of the body’s cells that carry the genetic information (in the form of genes) that tells the body how to develop, grow and function. Chromosomes usually come in pairs, with one chromosome from each pair coming from the father and one from the mother. Of the 46 chromosomes, two are a pair of sex chromosomes, XX (two X chromosomes) in females and XY (one X and one Y chromosome) in males. 2 1p interstitial deletions A chromosome 1p deletion means that the cells of the body have some genetic material missing from one of their 46 chromosomes, in this case from chromosome 1. For healthy development, chromosomes should contain just the right amount of genetic material – not too much and not too little.Chromosomes are made up of a DNA-protein complex called chromatin that is organized into subunits called nucleosomes. The way in which eukaryotes compact and arrange their chromatin not only allows a large amount of DNA to fit in a small space, but it also helps regulate gene expression. eBooks. Each chromosome contains a single double-stranded piece of DNA along with the aforementioned packaging proteins. Figure 1: Chromatin condensation changes during the cell cycle. During interphase (1), chromatin is in its least condensed state and appears loosely distributed throughout the nucleus.
where does the saltire come from	Content. Tradition relates that in AD 832 the king of the Picts, 'Aengus MacFergus', with the support of 'Scots' from Dalriada, won a great battle against King Athelstane of the Northumbrians. The site of the legendary battle became known as Athelstaneford in present-day East Lothian. It is said that before the battle, King Aengus dreamt of St Andrew bearing his Saltire cross. According to the legend, during the battle Aengus saw a cross of white clouds against a blue sky. The Picts and Scots won the battle. The Saltire-a white diagonal cross on a blue background-became the flag of Scotland and St Andrew was adopted as Scotland’s patron saint. The Scottish Flag Heritage Centre in Athelstaneford, near Haddington in East Lothian, tells the story of King Aengus and the BattleA saltire is a heraldic symbol in the form of a diagonal cross, like the shape of the letter X in Roman type. Saint Andrew is said to have been martyred on such a cross. It appears in numerous flags, including those of Scotland and Jamaica, and other coats of arms and seals. A variant, also appearing on many past and present flags and symbols, is the Cross of Burgundy flag. A warning sign in the shape of a saltire is also used to indicate the point at which a railway line intersects a road at a level crossing. In Unicode, the cross is encoded at U+2613 ☓ saltire (HTML &#9747;).

what are osteoblasts and osteoclasts	There are three types of cells in bone tissue; osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes. Osteocytes are considered as mature osteoblasts, and they do not secrete bone matrix. The function of the osteocyte is to maintain the metabolism and to exchange nutrients and eliminate wastes. Osteoblasts are the bone forming cells while osteoclasts have the opposite function of osteoblasts. Hence, these two cell types control the rates of formation and breakdown of bone or bone remodeling. Osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are small, mononucleate cells, responsible for bone formation. • Osteoblasts promote the formation of bones while osteoclasts promote the bone breakdown. • Osteoblasts become osteocytes, whereas osteoclasts do not. • Osteoblasts are smaller and mononucleate, whereas osteoclasts are larger and multinucleate. Related posts:Osteoblasts vs Osteoclasts. The skeletal system is basically made up bones. Bone tissue is considered as a hard but resilient tissue that is unique to vertebrates. The main functions of bones are to protect internal organs and to provide rigid support for muscle attachment. • Osteoblasts promote the formation of bones while osteoclasts promote the bone breakdown. • Osteoblasts become osteocytes, whereas osteoclasts do not. • Osteoblasts are smaller and mononucleate, whereas osteoclasts are larger and multinucleate.

what causes a muscle contraction to stop	Muscle Contraction. Muscle fibers contract in response to nerve stimuli from your central nervous system. This is an active process that involves the release of calcium at the cellular level of the muscle fiber, and causes a ratcheting effect that results in the shortening, or contracting, of individual muscle fibers. SHARE SHARE TWEET EMAIL. Muscle contraction and relaxation occurs in your body multiple times during the course of a day, especially if you are active. Muscles have fibers, and the fibers are grouped into fascicles, or bundles, which form individual skeletal muscles.Some of this calcium attaches to troponin which causes a change in the muscle cell that moves tropomyosin out of the way so the cross bridges can attach and produce muscle contraction. In summary the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction can be broken down into four distinct stages, these are; In order for a skeletal muscle contraction to occur; 1. There must be a neural stimulus. 2. There must be calcium in the muscle cells. 3. ATP must be available for energy. So, a few things can stop a contraction; 1. Energy system fatigue: There is no more ATP left in the muscle cell so it can’t keep contracting. 2. Nervous system fatigue: The nervous system is not able to create impulses sufficiently or quickly enough to maintain the stimulus and cause calcium to release.
what is caramel macchiato	One of my favorite beverages is the Caramel Macchiato, but for those who’ve never tried it, it’s a bit of a mystery. What does the word Macchiato mean, anyway? And how do you pronounce it? Macchiato, pronounced “mah-key-ah-toh,” literally means “marked” or “stained” in Italian. Traditionally, a Caffe Caffé macchiato Or Espresso macchiato is a shot or two of, espresso with just a small amount of steamed milk “that” marks the, espresso though in some, regions the steamed milk comes first and the espresso makes the. markThere is a lot of confusion about what a macchiato actually is, but that is because there is actually two types of a macchiato. What most people think of when they think of macchiato is a caramel macchiato. However, a caramel macchiato is not the original macchiato. Macchiato is Italian for marked with. A traditional cafe macchiato is espresso marked with foam. The drink is served in a small cup around 2 oz. The temperature of the drink is a bit cooler than a cappuccino. Americans invented something called a latte macchiato, which means milk marked with espresso. It is essentially a latte, but the milk is put in the cup first and then the shots of espresso last. This is what has become the caramel macchiato. So next time you go to order a macchiato, be sure to clarify if the shop does traditional cafe macchiatos or latte macchiatos
what element resists corrosion	The best corrosion resistant steels in the world find their way into countless applications, from defense to aerospace, turbines and more. Acidic degradation can be easily staved off by the addition of chromium, which not only strengthens the alloy, but creates a passive oxide layer that essentially seals in the metal. These days, corrosion-resistant metals come in any number of forms. You can get different temperances for heat, corrosion, strength and more, including widely varying hardness and weight. It is all a matter of which metals you add and what kind of treatments are used once the alloy has been melted.Stainless Steel Corrosion. The main reason for the existence of the stainless steels is their resistance to corrosion. Chromium is the main alloying element, and the steel should contain at least 11 %. Chromium is a reactive element, but it and its alloys passivate and exhibit excellent resistance to many environments. Higher Cr contents may be necessary for to improve the corrosion resistance of stainless steels in more aggressive media. Nitrogen is often added in modern stainless steels (especially in duplex grades or in highly alloyed austenitics); this element provides high mechanical properties, better resistance to pitting initiation and more generally improves the corrosion resistance thanks to a better microstructural stability.
common age levels for ptsd	The most traumatic events for women are rape, sexual molestation, physical attack, being threatened with a weapon, and childhood physical abuse. About 30 percent of the men and women who have spent time in war zones experience PTSD. An additional 20 to 25 percent have had partial PTSD at some point in their lives. An estimated 7.8 percent of Americans will experience PTSD at some point in their lives, with women (10.4%) twice as likely as men (5%) to develop PTSD. About 3.6 percent of U.S. adults aged 18 to 54 (5.2 million people) have PTSD during the course of a given year. This represents a small portion of those who have experienced at least one traumatic event; 60.7% of men and 51.2% of women reported at least one traumatic event. The traumatic events most often associated with PTSD for men are rape, combat exposure, childhood neglect, and childhood physical abuseHere are some common symptom patterns: 1  Some Veterans begin to have PTSD symptoms soon after they return from war. 2  Other Veterans don't have PTSD symptoms until later in life. 3  For some Veterans, PTSD symptoms can be high right after their war experience, go down over the years, and then worsen again later in life. Here are some common symptom patterns: 1  Some Veterans begin to have PTSD symptoms soon after they return from war. 2  These symptoms may last until older age. 3
hvac cost per ton residential new construction	Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes usually use between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions. What would be the approximate cost of a closed loop, multi-well (I know it will require that) system or heat and cool approximately 2300 square feet in North Texas climate. Hot summers and mild winters. This is new construction, not yet started, on 1 acre.Resolved Question: Whats the rule of thumb for cost estimating a new construction HVAC system / What should an HVAC system consisting of 3 Units x 13Seer[5 ton] split into 6 zones cost in a 3 story 5500 sq ft home (each floor is split into 2 zones). Submitted: 2 years ago. Category: HVAC. The ceilings on the top floor are also very high. Expert: Airheatman replied 2 years ago. Ok, as a rule of thumb you can figure about 1600 to 1800 per ton with the zone systems.So 8000 to 9000 per system. 3 systems would be in the 24,000 to 27,000 price range. With this said, I would get at least three estimates as contractors prices vary depending on their individual operating costs and mark up

average cost to have an inmate in prison in texas	The average cost of incarceration in the United States is determined by different methods. It costs anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 per year to house inmates in federal and state correctional facilities; the considerable spread is due to the criteria used by government agencies and prison system watchdogs. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, the average cost of housing an inmate in the U.S. was $31,286 in 2012. New York had the highest cost at $31,286 and Kentucky the lowest at $14,603. The Prison-Industrial Complex.By comparison, a non-death penalty murder case in nearby Lubbock County typically costs about $3,000, court officials estimate. The average cost to house an inmate in Texas prisons is $47.50 per day, according to Michelle Lyons, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Thus it would cost about $17,340 to house an inmate for a year and $693,500 for 40 years, far less than even part of the death penalty costs. The regional public defender's office estimates that just the legal costs for a death penalty case from indictment to execution are $1.2 million. County estimates in Texas indicate that the death penalty system is much more expensive than sentencing inmates to life imprisonment. Gray County spent nearly $1 million seeking the death penalty against Levi King, even though he pleaded guilty to murder.
how old do i have to be to be a bartender in texas	Bartending Age-Varies by State & City. State, county and city laws govern how old a person must be to legally bartend. As with most laws, the strictest applicable law is the one that must be followed. We have listed the STATE mandated bartending age in the table below for each state. Before making any decision about being a bartender, you should verify the correct age for your city if you are near the legal minimum. The state and/or city government website is a good place to start. Our schools train people of all ages and backgrounds. Our students range from 18 to 75 years of age. Regardless of your age or background there will always be a bar for you. Just like the customers that vary with each bar, the bartenders age usually follows that of the crowd they serve.Yet another reason that if I ever leave the great state of Texas you bet I will not set foot in Indiana. Even more strange is Illinois where you can serve at the age of 18...unless you are in the windy city of Chicago (which is the third largest in the nation) then you have to wait till you are 21. There are a plethora of different types of bars in the world, meaning there are a plethora of bartenders working in those bars! A bar with a clietele that skews younger (like a nightlcub on 6th street or clubs in downtown Houston) looks to hire people around the same age of their clientele.
how long does it take become a veterinarian	Waiting until after graduation could extend the amount of time it takes to become a veterinarian. Veterinary Doctorate. Professional veterinary programs are usually 4 years long. They are typically bisected into dual 2-year segments, focusing on classroom instruction and clinical practice, in that order. Graduates of accelerated programs may complete the education in as few as 6 to 7 years, while those who wish to advance in the field as specialist veterinarians generally spend at least 11 to 12 years in training. On average, it takes about 8 years after high school to become an entry-level veterinarian. Undergraduate Coursework. The bachelor’s degree is the most common qualification held by veterinary school applicants, but some students have master’s and doctoral degreesContents. There are 30 veterinary schools accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) in the U.S. There were nearly 6,800 applicants competing for approximately 2,700 openings in 2013. In other words, it is very competitive to gain admission to a veterinary school. Most U.S. veterinary schools require the following college courses (specific Penn State courses are listed in parentheses): 1  Two semesters of general chemistry with lab (CHEM 110, 111, 112, and 113). 2  Two semesters of organic chemistry with lab (CHEM 202 and 203; or CHEM 210, 212, and 213).
how many calories are in a cup of zucchini	The total fat content in an equal sized raw zucchini squash is 0.02 gram, total carbohydrate content in it is 0.33 gram, protein content in it is 0.12 gram, total sodium content in it is 1 mg and potassium content in it is 26 mg. Half a cup of boiled zucchini squash slices with salt contains around 14 calories. Out of which 88% of the calories come from carbohydrates, 9% calories come from proteins and a mere 3% of the calories come from fat. Zucchini is available in both raw as well as cooked forms and the calorie content in each of these forms is different. However, whichever form you consume it in the number of calories in it is low and this is the reason why it is preferred by many. One cup of raw chopped zucchini squash contains 20 calories. Out of these 20 calories 75% of the calories come from carbohydrates, 16% calories come from proteins and just 9% calories are obtainedHow many calories are in 1 serving? 18 calories are in 1 cup sliced-it is equivalent to 1.64 plum tomatoes (seeded and diced), 0.14 cups of yellow sweet corn, and 0.02 cups of chickpeas (raw).

In the same way, just 0% of all foods in our database have a lower cholesterol/calories ratio. For a healthy person, 0 mg is 0% of your daily recommended consumption.
what is brioche bread	Brioche can also be made in a pan without being rolled into balls to make an ordinary loaf. Brioche dough contains flour, eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and sometimes brandy), leavening (yeast or sourdough), salt, and sometimes sugar. Common recipes have a flour to butter ratio of about 2:1. Brioche is often cooked with fruit or chocolate chips and served as a pastry or as the basis of a dessert with many local variations in added ingredients, fillings or toppings. Brioche is eaten with dessert or tea, but also has numerous uses in cuisine. Common brioche dough is suitable for coulibiac and fillet of beef en croute. Brioche mousseline surrounds foie gras, sausage, cervelat lyonnais; ..Brioche is considered a Viennoiserie, in that it is made in the same basic way as bread, but has the richer aspect of a pastry because of the extra addition of eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and, sometimes, brandy) and occasionally a bit of sugar.

what is occult	1) Occult practice includes seeking God or truth beyond nature, reason, or the rational mind—that is, in the supernatural realm. 2) Occult practice is based on a belief that communion with God comes through subjective, supernatural experience outside biblical means (God's word or sacraments). 3) Occult practice involves seeking supernatural energy, spirits, power, presence, influence, action or enchantments. Occult practice has certain characteristics, one or more of which may be present in varying degrees: 1. Occult practice includes seeking God or truth beyond nature, reason and the rational mind—that is, directly in the supernatural realm apart from God's word and sacraments. 2. Occult practice is based on a belief that communion with God comes through subjective, supernatural experienceFor other uses, see Occult (disambiguation) . The occult (from the Latin word occultus clandestine, hidden, secret) is knowledge of the hidden. In common English usage, occult refers to knowledge of the paranormal , as opposed to knowledge of the measurable , usually referred to as science. Occult qualities are properties that have no known rational explanation; in the Middle Ages, for example, magnetism was considered an occult quality. Newton's contemporaries severely criticized his theory that gravity was effected through action at a distance, as occult.
why is collateral circulation important	This is often a result of anastamoses, branches formed between adjacent blood vessels. Collateral circulation can be established in the venous system (between veins) or in the arterial system (between arteries). It may arise from pathological conditions such as congestion or ischaemia. An example of the usefulness of collateral circulation is a systemic thrombo-embolism in cats. This is when a thrombus lodges above the external iliac artery (common iliac artery), blocking the external and internal iliac arteries and effectively shutting off all blood supply to the hind leg. Another example (in humans) is where a person suffers an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). Collateral circulation in the heart tissue will sometimes bypass the blockage in the main artery and supply enough oxygenated blood to enable the cardiac tissue to survive and recover.When an artery in the brain is blocked due to stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), open collateral vessels can (but not always) allow blood to detour around the blockage. This collateral circulation restores blood flow to the affected part of the brain. When a collateral vessel on the heart enlarges, it lets blood flow from an open coronary artery to an adjacent one or further downstream on the same artery. In this way, collateral vessels grow and form a kind of detour around a blockage.
how long should you leave spices on steak before cooking?	1 Salt your steak at least 40 minutes before you cook it. 2  Most cooks salt their steaks right before placing it on the grill. 3  Because salt is a desiccant, this draws the moisture out to the surface of the steak, where it gets seared off immediately. 4  This produces mostly an underwhelming steak. 1 First, a steak that has come to room temperature will cook more evenly. 2  You won't have a hot exterior and a chilly interior. 3  Second, the steak will cook quicker. 4  This means less time on the grill, or the frying pan, or in the oven, and more time spent sipping wine.About 20 minutes before grilling, remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let sit, covered, at room temperature. Heat your grill to high. Brush the steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Place the steaks on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the steaks over and continue to grill 3 to 5 minutes for medium-rare (an internal temperature of 135 degrees F), 5 to 7 minutes for medium (140 degrees F) or 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well (150 degrees F). I salt and season mine at least an hour before cooking and let them sit at room temperature. Throw some hickory chips on the coals and you've got yourself a steak to die for! Thank you, Bobby, for not insulting a luscious rib-eye steak with a marinade.
how many states have already passed legislation allowing driverless cars	In this period Google has led the way in trying to convince the public that the idea of driverless cars is not such an alien one. In April 2012, Florida became the second U.S state to allow testing of driverless cars on public roads. California, passed legislation permitting the testing of driverless cars in 2012, as did Washington D.C. The latest US state to promote the project was Michigan, which passed legislation in December of last year.In April 2012, Florida became the second state to allow the testing of autonomous cars on public roads, and California became the third when Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law at Google HQ in Mountain View. In December 2013, Michigan became the fourth state to allow testing of driverless cars on public roads. In July 2014, the city of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho adopted a robotics ordinance that includes provisions to allow for self-driving cars. The team developing the system consisted of 15 engineers working for Google, including Chris Urmson, Mike Montemerlo, and Anthony Levandowski who had worked on the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges. Legislation has been passed in four U.S. states and Washington, D.C. allowing driverless cars. The state of Nevada passed a law on June 29, 2011, permitting the operation of autonomous cars in Nevada, after Google had been lobbying in that state for robotic car law
when was the writing instrument invented	600-1800 AD The Europeans found that writing on parchment with a quill pen altered the style of their writing. At first they used capital letters all the time, but later they developed faster styles with small letters. Quill Pens (firstly appeared in Seville, Spain) were the writing instrument from 600 to 1800 AD. 1790s Pencil lead was invented independently in France and Australia. 1800-1850 A metal pen point has been patented in 1803 but patent was not commercially exploited. Steel nibs came into common use in the 1830s. Around 3000 BC The Egyptians developed a form of writing with pictures. For writing on papyrus scrolls scribes used thin reed brushes or reed pens. 1300 BC The Romans have been developing form of writing, that they scribed into thin sheets of wax (on wooden tablets). Romans used a metal styluThe writing instrument that dominated for the longest period in history (over one-thousand years) was the quill pen. Introduced around 700 A.D., the quill is a pen made from a bird feather. The strongest quills were those taken from living birds in the spring from the five outer left wing feathers. The history of writing instruments by which humans have recorded and conveyed thoughts, feelings and grocery lists, is the history of civilization itself. This is how we know the story of us, by the drawings, signs and words we have recorded.
what causes elevated alkaline phosphatase in dogs	Elevated alkaline phosphatase in pets is diagnosed by conducting a blood test. At the time of injury and other normal activities, this enzyme is released into the bloodstream. Though a blood test determines the high level of alkaline phosphatase in the body, it is not effective to identify the source of elevation. By elevated alkaline phosphatase, we mean that the amount of ALP is higher than the recommended levels. Similar to humans, elevated alkaline phosphatase in dogs can be related to certain health problems. The exact reasons for elevated alkaline phosphatase in pet dogs are not known as yet. In majority of cases, this abnormality is related to liver problems and bone diseases. It is estimated that a pet dog showing very high amounts of ALP has more than 50 percent chances of developing liver and bone diseasesIf the ALP level is high, more tests may be done to find the cause. The amounts of different types of ALP in the blood may be measured and used to determine whether a high level is from the liver or bones. This is called an alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes test. A test for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is done to: 1  Check for liver disease or damage to the liver. 2  Check bone problems (sometimes found on X-rays), such as rickets, bone tumors, Paget's disease, or too much of the hormone that controls bone growth (parathyroid hormone).
in which year was the first electric printing press invented	Typically used for texts, the invention of the printing press is widely regarded as one of the most influential events in the second millennium, ushering in the period of modernity. Movable-type presses using cast ceramics were employed in China from the early years of the last millennium. In 1377, the first movable metallic types were invented in Goryeo Dynasty in Korea, which were used to print Jikjishimcheyojeol or simply Jikji, which is the oldest extant movable metal print book. The printing press was introduced to the West in the Holy Roman Empire by Johannes Gutenberg, around 1440. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, devised a hand mould to create metal movable type, and adapted screw presses and other existing technologies, to create a printing systemThe Story: In the mid-15th century Johannes Gutenberg invented a mechanical way of making books. This was the first example of mass book production. Before the invention of printing, multiple copies of a manuscript had to be made by hand, a laborious task that could take many years. In 1455, Gutenberg demonstrated the power of the printing press by selling copies of a two-volume Bible for a price that was the equivalent of approximately three years' wages for an average clerk, but it was significantly cheaper than a handwritten Bible that could take a single monk 20 years to transcribe.
where do brolgas come from	Brolgas are found right across northern Australia from around Carnarvon in Western Australia, through the top half of the Northern Territory and throughout eastern Australia covering most of Queensland, News South Wales and Victoria. But the twentieth century was not kind to Brolgas. In the northern part of their range, particularly in Queensland, a single flock of Brolgas can still number 12,000 birds. In the south, however, it's another story. Apart from sporadic sightings along the coast, they have pretty much disappeared from that regionThe brolga (Grus rubicunda), formerly known as the native companion, is a bird in the crane family. It has also been given the name Australian crane, a term coined in 1865 by well-known ornithological artist John Gould in his Birds of Australia. The brolga is a common, gregarious wetland bird species of tropical and south-eastern Australia and New Guinea. It is a tall, upright bird with a small head, long beak, slender neck and long legs. The plumage is mainly grey, with black wing tips, and it has an orange-red band of colour on its head. In northern Australia, during the dry season (June to November), populations of brolgas are gregarious and largely occupy a strip of freshwater marshland up to 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide, lying between the coastal hills and the saline mangrove swamps that fringe the sea.
_____________ the highest point of elevation in australia is located in the australian alps	The highest point on the Australian mainland is Mt Kosciuszko, at 2228m (some sources say 2229m), or 7310 feet. It is situated in the Australian Alps, in southern New South Wales. Whilst Australia's highest mainland mountain is Kosciuszko, the highest point in or on any of Australia's territory is Mawson Peak on the Australian external territory of Heard Island is higher, at 2745 m. The tallest mountain in Australia is Mt  Kosciuszko, at 2228m (some sources say 2229m), or 7310  feet. It is situated in the Australian Alps, in southern New South  Wales. …    Whilst Australia's highest mainland mountain is Kosciuszko, Mawson  Peak on the Australian external territory of Heard Island is The Australian Alps, an interim Australian bioregion, is the highest mountain range in Australia. This range is located in southeastern Australia, and it straddles eastern Victoria, southeastern New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Alps contain Australia's only peaks exceeding 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in elevation above sea level. The Australian Alps are the main region in which skiing in Australia takes place (although skiing is also possible in Tasmania). Skiable terrain stretches through large areas of territory from June to October. New South Wales is home to Australia's highest snow country, oldest skifields and largest resort.
what is stapedial myoclonus	Myoclonus describes a symptom and not a diagnosis of a disease. It refers to sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles. Myoclonic twitches or jerks usually are caused by sudden muscle contractions, called positive myoclonus, or by muscle relaxation, called negative myoclonus. Myoclonic jerks may occur alone or in sequence, in a pattern or without pattern. They may occur infrequently or many times each minute. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. The drug of first choice to treat myoclonus, especially certain types of action myoclonus, is clonazepam, a type of tranquilizer. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the individual improves or side effects become harmfulMyoclonus may develop in response to infection, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, or other disorders. Prolonged oxygen deprivation to the brain, called hypoxia, may result in posthypoxic myoclonus. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. The drug of first choice to treat myoclonus, especially certain types of action myoclonus, is clonazepam, a type of tranquilizer. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the individual improves or side effects become harmful
what is a good credit score to get approved for a target card	A fair credit score of 602 is the recommended minimum credit score, but those with lower scores have been approved for these cards. Those with excellent credit are almost guaranteed approval for a Target card. The average interest rate on a Target REDCard is 22.90% and this is a variable interest rate. One can expect this higher interest rate when approved with a fair credit score. Those with higher credit scores are likely to get credit on better terms – meaning a higher credit limit and a lower interest rate. It seems like every time you see a free credit score, it is tied to your credit card. You may get a free trial but then your card is charged for a monthly fee. However, there are a few places where you can get your credit score truly free. No credit card required.The average approval rate on the Target card is about 72%, meaning they have an average approval rate. There is no annual fee associated with this card, and no monthly maintenance fees. Like with most cards, the better your credit history and credit score, the more likely you are to be approved, and at better terms. It seems like every time you see a free credit score, it is tied to your credit card. You may get a free trial but then your card is charged for a monthly fee. However, there are a few places where you can get your credit score truly free. No credit card required.
how to solve for holding period yield	Add the cash flows to the holding period's ending investment value. In the example, if stock ABC rose to $125 per share, add $125 plus $4 to calculate a total value of $129 per share. Divide this figure by the investment's value at the beginning of the holding period. In the example, if you purchased stock ABC for $50, divide $129 by $50 to calculates a multiplier of 2.58. Subtract one from the multiplier to calculates the HPR in decimal format. In the example, 2.58 minus 1 calculates an HPR of 1.58. Multiply this figure by 100 to convert it to percent format. In the example, 1.58 times 100 converts the decimal format to a 158 percent return on investment during the holding period.What is the 'Holding Period Return/Yield'. The total return received from holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a period of time, generally expressed as a percentage. Holding period return/yield is calculated on the basis of total returns from the asset or portfolio – i.e. income plus changes in value. It is particularly useful for comparing returns between investments held for different periods of time. where t = number of years. Returns for regular time periods such as quarters or years can be converted to a holding period return through the following formula: (1 + HPR) = (1 + r1) x (1 + r2) x (1 + r3) x (1 + r4) where r1, r2, r3and r4are periodic returns.
adaptations of seedless vascular plants	Finally, these plants are gametophyte dominant, meaning that the recognizable stage of these plants is the haploid gametophyte generation. The seedless vascular plants, which include ferns and fern allies, possess several adaptations lacking in nonvascular plants. Xylem and phloem are present to efficiently transport water and sugars, respectively throughout the plant body. As photosynthetic autotrophs, plants use solar energy to produce organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water. The plant kingdom consists of four major groups: the nonvascular plants, the seedless vascular plants, the gymnosperms and the angiosperms. The nonvascular plants, such as mosses and liverworts, are one of the simplest groups of the true plantsSeedless Vascular Plants. The next group of plants are sometimes referred to as seedless vascular plants.. The plants in this group have true xylem and phloem which makes them vascular by anyone's definition. They are seedless because they reproduce by means of spores. Beyond this definition, these organisms have the same feature set as the bryophytes we have just finished studying. Seedless vascular plants are in Kingdom Plantae, have chlorophylls a and b with carotenoid and xanthophyll accessory pigments. They store starch and have cellulose-pectin cell walls. The plants are all oogamous and have a sporic life history.
basal angiosperm characteristics	In particular, the most basal angiosperms were called the ANITA grade which is made up of Amborella (a single species of shrub from New Caledonia), Nymphaeales (water lilies, together with some other aquatic plants) and Austrobaileyales (woody aromatic plants including star anise). The basal angiosperms are the flowering plants which diverged from the lineage leading to most flowering plants.Basal Angiosperms Characteristics. The first plants to make an appearance on the face of the Earth were gymnosperms. They are said to have given rise to flowering plants about 245 to 202 million years ago. The first flowering plants that deviate from the initial angiosperms are called basal angiosperms. Delving into the evolutionary past of basal angiosperms, one finds few groups that branch off, before the true 'dicots' appear. The basal angiosperms consisted of the Ambroella, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales. In the plant kingdom, the division Spermatophyta is divided into gymnosperms and angiosperms. The most diverse and dominant group of plants among the two are angiosperms, also referred to as magnoliophyta. In common terms, angiosperms are all flowering plants. They are distinguished from gymnosperms, by their ability to flower and produce seeds enclosed in fruits. There are a few other characteristics that are discussed in the following paragraph

where is hwanseongul cave	Hwanseon Cave (환선굴) is a cave located in Gangwon province, South Korea. It is one of the largest limestone caves in Asia, and the biggest in Korea, with 6.2 km of known passages and a total suspected length of 8 km, 1.6 km of which are visited by over 1 million people per year. Situated in a rugged karst range near the city of Samcheok, the cave's 10 m tall entrance is a grueling 30 to 45 minute uphill hike from the ticket office. Once inside, the temperature varies between 10° and 14°C.Regardless, you get to pay for each cave at the same toll booth, near the parking lot. Beware-each cave is a separate ticket, and in the case of the tram (yes tram) for Hwanseongul, you pay for that separately at the tram station up the valley. The tram fee is included in the cave fee for Daegeumgul. The Cave fee for Hwanseongul was only ~$4, and the tram fee was an additional ~$7, round trip. If the weather is nice, I would recommend the walk. The tram does elevate you above the trees however, providing a very nice view of some impressive karst terrain. You can find travel directions for Hwanseongul here: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/ ... cid=264551. SO, our second cave on this trip was Hwanseongul. (gul means cave, so I will dispense with the redundancy.) Hwanseongul and Daegeumgul are located in the same valley, on opposite sides from each other.

relationship between money supply and inflation in pakistan	The macroeconomic variables namely: money supply, income velocity of circulation, real effective exchange rate and real income of the economy are the main affect of inflation. The objective of the study was to investigate the impact of real effective exchange rate on inflation in Pakistan. The time series data of real GDP, nominal GDP, real effective exchange rate, prices and money supply for the period of 1973 to 2007 was used in the study. It was concluded that the real effective exchange rate has impact upon inflation in Pakistan. The required econometric model was specified in the logarithmic form. The relationship between inflation and real effective exchange rate in Pakistan was determined by the ordinary least square (OLS) method. The estimated coefficient between inflation and real effective exchange rate was 0.01 and was not significant.The result of one to one relationship between the growth rate of money supply and the rate of inflation is consistent with the other studies such as McCandless and Weber (1995), Rolnick and Weber (1994) and Lucus (1980), among others. We tested this hypothesis that inflation and money growth relative to real income are proportional.

calculate inventory carrying cost per unit	EXAMPLE: A firm’s inventory currently turns over 6 times per year, and the firm’s annual unit flow through the warehouse is 180,000 units. The firm’s average inventory is 180,000/6 or 30,000 units. Assume the carrying cost of inventory is 25% and the cost of a unit is $10. The inventory investment is 30,000 x $10 = $300,000. The annual inventory carrying cost is $300,000 x .25 = $75,000. If the firm increases inventory turnover from 6 to 9 turns per year and maintains the same level of product flow, the average inventory would be 180,000/9 = 20,000 units or $200,000. There are two important influences at work here. Carrying costs will now be $200,000 x .25 = $50,000 per year, which equates to an annual savings of $25,000 ($75,000 - $50,000). As the example demonstrates, inventory turnover is a critical performance metric to assess the effectiveness of inventory management.Annual demand is 20,000 units so the company will have to place 16 orders (= annual demand of 20,000 divided by order size of 1,265). Total ordering cost is hence $64,000 ($400 multiplied by 16). Average inventory held is 632.5 ((0+1,265)/2) which means total carrying costs of $6,325 (i.e. 632.5 × $10). The company has a demand for 20,000 units per year. Calculate the order size, total orders required during a year, total carrying cost and total ordering cost for the year.

what is linear in a graph	Best Answer: a linear graph is a mathematical illustration of identities with just a line either in its reverse or original form, when it is in its reverse it is a negative linear basically it is always a straight line graph that always has a slope y= mx+c that is the equation hope that helps a bit. Source(s): Report Abuse. A liner graph is a graph that explains a liner relationship. A linear relationship is a relationship in which the amount goes up or down in the same incriment each time, or stays the same, So a linear graph would have to have a straight line, usually diagonal, going through the various points.A linear line is just a straight line. To graph it, you can use this equation: y=mx+b where m = the slope of the line, and b = the y-intercept of the line, in other words, … where the line crosses the y-axis. 6 people found this useful. The set of all such ordered pairs defines the graph of y = mx + c, called a learning linear graphing.In the equation y = mx + c, the number m is called the slope of the line and c is known as the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. Sometimes the y-intercept c is 0. In this situation, the equations of the line is y = mx and we say that the line passes through the origin.The basic principle behind drawing a linear graph is that only two points are needed to graph a straight line
how far apart leeks to be planted	Transplant the leeks. Plant the leek seedlings at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep and 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart. Pat the soil around the base of the leak so that it covers the roots and reaches the cleft where the leaves spread apart. Prepare a permanent bed for the seedlings. Choose a spot in the sun that has well-draining soil. Work compost into the soil to a depth of at least 8 inches (20.3 cm). Dig a trench 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep. Leeks must be planted deep in the soil so that the base of the stem stays out of the sun and becomes blanched.. The blanched part is the white, tender, edible part of the leekAn easy method to use when planting leeks is called drilling. After the soil has been turned over and hoed, and the weeds removed, drag the hoe, point down to make a shallow trench (about 5 inches or 13 centimeters). Trenches should be about two feet apart to allow a person to work between rows. Some varieties will tolerate frost and some will even over-winter if they are mulched. Their ideal temperature is a range from 13-24° C (55-75° F) . Leeks can be planted directly in the soil. If so, plant early to take advantage of the cooler spring season. However, remember that a hard frost can still kill them off. For this reason, many people like to start plants indoors. This can be done six to eight weeks before the actual growing season begin

what is a fundamental frequency	Fundamental and Harmonics. The lowest resonant frequency of a vibrating object is called its fundamental frequency. Most vibrating objects have more than one resonant frequency and those used in musical instruments typically vibrate at harmonics of the fundamental. A harmonic is defined as an integer (whole number) multiple of the fundamental frequency. Vibrating strings, open cylindrical air columns, and conical air columns will vibrate at all harmonics of the fundamental. Cylinders with one end closed will vibrate with only odd harmonics of the fundamentalThe fundamental frequency, often referred to simply as the fundamental, is defined as the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform. In music, the fundamental is the musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present. In terms of a superposition of sinusoids (e.g. Fourier series), the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum. In some contexts, the fundamental is usually abbreviated as f0 (or FF), indicating the lowest frequency counting from zero. By the same method as above, the fundamental frequency is found to be. At 20 °C (68 °F) the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s (1129 ft/s). This speed is temperature dependent and does increase at a rate of 0.6 m/s for each degree Celsius increase in temperature (1.1 ft/s for every increase of 1 °F).

For perpendicular or angled parking spaces, the length is commonly 16 feet to 18 feet or 4.9 meters to 5.5 meters. Meanwhile, the standard width is 7.9 feet to 9 feet or 2.4 meters to 2.75 meters. Some other versions of this type of parking space measure between 7.5 feet and 10 feet or 2.3 meters and 3.2 meters. For parallel parking spaces, the standard width is 7.9 feet or 2.4 meters while the standard length is 20 feet or 6.1 meters. They are usually marked 6.9 feet to 7.9 feet or 2.1 meters to 2.4 meters wide
how long does an appraisal last	1 Most appraisals are good for 60-90 days. 2  Some appraisals are accepted up to 120 days as a matter of course. 3  FHA only accepts appraisals up to 120 days and allows recertification of 30 additional days. In a declining market, an appraisal’s term of validity is shorter. The maximum age of an appraisal is 6 months, the same as acceptable comparable property sales. While you may never see an expiration date on a property appraisal, many lenders will not accept an appraisal that is more than 120 days old. Some lenders will also request an appraisal dated after the contract date in any case. To recap: Most appraisals are good for 60-90 days. Some appraisals are accepted up to 120 days as a matter of course. FHA only accepts appraisals up to 120 days and allows recertification of 30 additional days.Under most loan guidelines, appraisals do not have a set expiration period. However, because lenders want comps that are no more than six months past, an appraisal should be no more than six months old. Most appraisers and lenders agree six months is the maximum amount of time that an appraisal holds a valid value, referred to as the “term of validity.”. In this kind of market, lenders may want an appraisal to be no more than 90 to 120 days old. FHA guidelines once called for an appraisal to be considered valid for six months until January 2010.
origin of term doldrums	Origin. The Doldrums is the region of calm winds, centered slightly north of the equator and between the two belts of trade winds, which meet there and neutralize each other. It is widely assumed that the phrase 'in the doldrums' is derived from the name of this region. Actually, it's the other way about. In the 19th century, 'doldrum' was a word meaning 'dullard; a dull or sluggish fellow' and this probably derived from 'dol', meaning 'dull' with its form taken from 'tantrum'. From the bluff head where I watch'd to-day, I saw her in the doldrums; for the wind Was light and baffling. [Note: baffling winds are those which are shifting and variable, making progress under sail impossible.]. The 'equatorial doldrums' is another of these calm places.More. To most people the doldrums refers to a state or period of stagnation or depression, but to sailors it is an equatorial region of the Atlantic Ocean with calms, sudden storms, and light unpredictable winds. For sailing ships, being becalmed in the doldrums was a serious occupational hazard. 1 On the equator there is little wind, mariners called this region the doldrums (after an old English word meaning dull) because they feared being stranded there. 2  The trade winds from both hemispheres converge towards the doldrums and a zone of low pressure, the equatorial trough, that girdles the earth.
at what age does an eagle fly	Q. About how long does it take for the bald eagle's eggs to hatch and how long until it can fly? A. It takes 35 days to hatch, then young in nest 10-12 weeks more unti lthey fledge (fly from nest). Q. How old are they before young eagles can fly? A. At 10-12 weeks, when they leave their nest. Q. When do eagles learn to fly and how? A. At between 10-12 weeks as they first leave the nest (fledge), and then with more and more practice to and from the nest and surrounding trees over the next month or two. Another study estimated that only 11 % of eagles were alive after 3 years of life. In general, we believe that only about 1 in 10 eagles survive to adulthood (5 yrs of age). Ecology Q. How many pounds of food does a Bald Eagle eat in a day? A. Approximately .5 - 1.5 per day.10) When can eaglets start to fly? An eagle can take its first flight, some 10 to 13 weeks after hatching—when downy feathers are replaced by juvenile feathers. 11) How fast can eagles fly? An eagle flies at approximately 30-55 miles per hour and can dive at 100 miles per hour. Eggs are laid a few days apart and consequently hatch in the order they were laid. Female eaglets tend to be larger than their male counterparts. Like most birds of prey, the female adult is also larger than the male. Adult eagles range from 33-35 inches long for males and 35-37 inches for females.

The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as  GSD , and was also formerly known as the Alsatian and Alsatian Wolf Dog in Britain. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog and was the first dog added to the society's breed register. Horand became the centre-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia and Wurttemberg.The German Shepherd Dog, also known as an Alsatian, is a breed of medium-sized dog that originated in Germany.

hair loss during pregnancy causes	Pregnancy affects the entire body, including hair, skin and nails. Often, there are undesirable changes that can leave a pregnant woman worried or frightened. However, hair loss in particular is very common during pregnancy and should not cause undue concern. Hair loss is especially common just after pregnancy. Hair loss during and after pregnancy can be due to hormonal problems. An overactive or underactive thyroid can cause hair to fall out. If this is the case, your physician can treat the hair loss by treating the thyroid disease. Hair loss during pregnancy may also be a sign of a vitamin or mineral deficiency. There are a number of things that you can do to have a healthier head of hair and/or reduce the extent of some of the hair loss during pregnancy or after delivery: – Consult with your physician to ensure a proper balance of hormones.After delivery, the hormones return to normal levels, which allows the hair to fall out and return to the normal cycle. The normal hair loss that was delayed during pregnancy may fall out all at once. Up to 60% of your hair that is in the growth state may enter into the telogen resting state. The Positive Side of Pregnancy and Your Hair: During pregnancy there is an increase in the level of estrogen hormones. Estrogen causes hair to remain in the growing phase and stimulates the growth of your hair.
what does exophytic papillomas mean	The cortical cyst refers to a very common type of kidney cyst. Because it is located at the renal cortex, it is called the cortical cyst.“Exophytic” means that the cyst grows out of' and can be seen as a feature of certain renal tumors. Home FAQs. Answer: Thank you for your consultation. Firstly, I want to give you an introduction of exophytic cortical cyst. The cortical cyst refers to a very common type of kidney cyst. Because it is located at the renal cortex, it is called the cortical cyst. It is a fluid-filled sac growing in the outer area of the kidneys. You might have one, or you might have several, and they can affect just one or both kidneyA papilloma (plural papillomas or papillomata) (papillo- + -oma) is a benign epithelial tumor growing exophytically (outwardly projecting) in nipple-like and often finger-like fronds. In this context papilla refers to the projection created by the tumor, not a tumor on an already existing papilla (such as the nipple). When used without context, it frequently refers to infections (squamous cell papilloma) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), such as warts. Human papillomavirus infection is a major cause of cervical cancer, although most HPV infections do not cause cancer. There are, however, a number of other conditions that cause papilloma, as well as many cases in which there is no known cause
how long does it take to cook potato cubes in a microwave	So, like lot of people, I often zap potatoes in the microwave. In less then 10 minutes, they get cooked, covered with sour cream and bacon, and I’m ready to turn on the TV. Here’s how to cook a potato in the microwave oven. If you are baking potatoes in the oven, you can rub a small amount of oil on them so that the skin gets nice and crispy. It is not necessary to rub oil on potatoes you are cooking in the microwave oven. Place the potato on a microwave-safe dish. Check the small print on the back of the dish to be sure.Step 5. Return the potatoes to the microwave and continue cooking in 1-minute intervals until they are soft to the center and you can easily pierce them with a fork. You should be able to cook one to two medium potatoes in 3 to 5 minutes, but a large bowl of six potatoes might take 10 minutes or more. Step 1. Scrub the potatoes under cold running water and blot them dry with paper towels. Cut the potatoes into cubes roughly 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter. You can peel the potatoes first or leave the peels intact. Add the potatoes to a microwave-safe bowl or spread them on a microwave-safe plate. Add your choice of herbs and spices, if desired. At the very least, the potatoes benefit from salt to add flavor, but you might also add pepper, butter and herbs. Cover the dish with plastic wrap to trap in steam and prevent drying
what are gerbils	The gerbil was originally known as a desert rat until they were commercially introduced to North America and bred as pets.The gerbil is a small rodent, similar in many ways... Gerbils are naturally found in the sandy plains of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The gerbil was originally known as a desert rat until they were commercially introduced to North America and bred as pets. The gerbil is a small rodent, similar in many ways to by the mouse and the hamster. Gerbils have a long tail like a mouse which the gerbil is able to shed should the tail get trapped. This self defense mechanism allows the gerbil to escape predators, leaving them with just a tail. Gerbils have sharp claws which the gerbils use to burrow their way into the sandy grounds of the desert.Gerbils. Gerbils are generally diurnal animals (active during the day), constructing deep, dark, underground burrows. Gerbils may live for up to 3-4 years, although some may live longer. Take a look at our pet search page to find gerbils up for rehoming. Your duty of care. Gerbils are often kept by young children, because they have a great deal of character. However, their needs are actually very complex and owning one is a big responsibility. If you own or are responsible for gerbils, even on a temporary basis, you are required under the Animal Welfare Act to care for them properly.
significance of force act	The Force Acts became meaningful again in the 1950s. At that time, the Civil Rights Movement started to use the power of the federal government against discriminatory laws passed by the states. The Force Acts established the idea that the federal government could step in and enforce rights when states would not. This was what the federal government did in many instances during the Civil Rights Era. Thus, the Force Acts helped to make the Civil Rights Movement possible. They were important in that they established the idea that the federal government could act to force the states to obey federal law. In the later parts of Reconstruction, Southern states had regained much of their sovereignty.The Meaning of Force. A force is a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object. Whenever there is an interaction between two objects, there is a force upon each of the objects. When the interaction ceases, the two objects no longer experience the force. Forces. exist as a result of an interaction. The downward force of gravity and the upward force of the table supporting the book act in opposite directions and thus balance each other. However, the force of friction acts leftwards, and there is no rightward force to balance it. In this case, an unbalanced force acts upon the book to change its state of motion.
what is an electronegative element	The opposite of electronegativity is electropositivity: a measure of an element's ability to donate electrons. Caesium is the least electronegative element in the periodic table (=0.79), while fluorine is most electronegative (=3.98). (Francium and caesium were originally assigned both assigned 0.7; caesium's value was later refined to 0.79, but no experimental data allows a similar refinement for francium. Properties of a free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity. It is to be expected that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its chemical environment, but it is usually considered to be a transferable property, that is to say that similar values will be valid in a variety of situations.Here is a look at the most electronegative element and an explanation for why it has such high electronegativity. Answer: Fluorine is the most electronegative element. Fluorine has an electronegativity of 3.98 on the Pauling Electronegativity Scale and a valence of 1. A fluorine atom needs one electron to fill its outer electron shell and achieve stability, which is why free fluorine exists as the F-ion. Other highly electronegative elements are oxygen and chlorine. The element hydrogen does not have as high of an electronegativity because, although it has a half-filled shell, it readily loses an electron rather than gains one.
cost of moving a house to a new location	Most house moving companies want to physically inspect a house and the desired placement location before estimating the cost for them to move it. The cost for moving any size house can range between $12 and $16 per square foot, so obviously a smaller house with not a long distance to travel will be cheaper to move. The roads traveled during the move can add to the cost of the move. Before making the decision to move a house, people should contact a professional house moving company to get an estimate on how much it will cost to move the house. The entire process can become pretty costly when all other expenses are factored in, but it could still be less than purchasing a new one.Based on my experience in the field, packing costs can be similar to the moving cost itself. A 4 bedroom house can take more than 12h to move from one town to another. In this case your average moving costs will be around $1800 to $2500 without including any packing. For an accurate moving estimate calculation use our fast & easy free moving calculator. For example if you’re moving from Chicago to Boston, MA and you live in a 4 bedroom house, your average moving cost with a full service moving company can go over $10000. But if you are moving locally within 100 miles from your old place, this cost will be based on hourly rate and will vary from company to company.
does fatback go0 bad	1: fatback. Fatback is a cut of meat from a domestic pig. It consists of the layer of adipose tissue (subcutaneous fat) under the skin of the back, with or without the skin (pork rind).Fatback is  hard fat , distinct from the visceral fat that occurs in the abdominal cavity and is called soft fat and leaf lard.Like other types of pig fat, fatback may be rendered to make a high quality lard, and is one source of salt pork.atback is processed into slab bacon by many methods, including brine curing, dry curing, smoking, or boiling. Usually the skin (rind) is left on. This fatback bacon is widely eaten throughout Europe. In Polish, it is called boczek, since it comes from the side of the pig and has long been a key component of bigos.I have a 1-liter container of mixed duck fat and lard that's been in there for about two years total, during which time I've melted it, used it, re-rendered it (carefully!) and strained it back in there, each time making up any loss with lard, I think about three times.

who invented the first radio	Reginald Fessenden was a Canadian inventor reputed for his achievements in early radio. The first audio transmission by radio in 1900, the first two-way transatlantic radio transmission in 1906, and the first radio broadcast of entertainment and music in 1906, were his three significant milestones. The question as to who invented the radio does not have a specific answer. There have been numerous theories and patents filed for credits. In case of the discovery of the radio, one fine understanding is that many theories and principles went into a completed circuit of the radio.After Hertz's work many people were involved in further development of the electronic components and methods to improve the transmission and detection of electromagnetic waves. Around the turn of the 20th century Guglielmo Marconi, developed the first apparatus for long distance radio communication. Reginald A. Fessenden became the first to send audio (wireless telephony) by means of electromagnetic waves in 1907. By 1910 these systems had come to be referred to by the common name radio. Marconi's demonstrations of the use of radio for wireless communications, equipping ships with life saving wireless communications, establishing the first transatlantic radio service, and building the first stations for the British shortwave service, have marked his place in history.
different respiratory infections	Respiratory tract infection refers to any of a number of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. An infection of this type is normally further classified as an upper respiratory tract infection (URI or URTI) or a lower respiratory tract infection (LRI or LRTI). This includes the nose, sinuses, pharynx, and larynx. Typical infections of the upper respiratory tract include tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, certain types of influenza, and the common cold. Symptoms of URIs can include cough, sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, headache, low grade fever, facial pressure and sneezingThe  common cold  is usually caused by a viral infection and treatment is directed at managing symptoms while the body's own immune system fights the infection. Common symptoms of an upper respiratory infection such as a cold include a runny nose, post-nasal drip, cough, and nasal congestion. If laryngitis develops (larynx=voice box + itis=inflammation), the patient may lose their voice or become hoarse. The respiratory tract is divided into two categories based anatomy. 1  The upper respiratory tract includes the mouth, nose, throat, larynx (voice box), and trachea (windpipe). 2  Upper respiratory infections are often referred to as  colds 3  .. The lower respiratory tract includes the bronchial tubes and the lungs.
how to store tomatillos	Tomatillos are related to tomatoes, which are in the Nightshade family. They are similar in shape but are ripe when green, yellow or purple and have a husk around the fruit. The fruits are borne on warm season plants and from inside the husk. You can tell when to pick a tomatillo by watching for the husk to burst. The plant produces papery shells and the fruit grows to fill the husk. As soon as the dry exterior splits, it is time for tomatillo harvesting. Once you know when to harvest tomatillos you will need to decide how to use them. Tomatillos store well in a cool, dry location. They can hold for several weeks in this manner.Set tomatillos, still in their husks, in a dry and ventilated area such as a hanging basket in your pantry; they last for about 2 months. Place the tomatillos (with husks on) in a paper bag and set them in the crisper drawer or in a bowl with a paper towel over them in your fridge; they will last for about 1 month. Make sure they don't get wet or the inside of their husk could become a little slimy. Place them in plastic freezer bags and set them back in the freezer; the will keep for 6 to 10 months. Husk and wash the tomatillos and then cut them up. Stick them in a blender and puree. You can also puree them with other vegetables to be used in salsas and sauces. Pour them into ice trays and put them in the freezer
why was there cable transatlantic	A transatlantic telegraph cable is an undersea cable running under the Atlantic Ocean used for telegraph communications. The first was laid across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island in western Ireland to Heart's Content in eastern Newfoundland. Before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day.TAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first transatlantic telephone cable system. It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship Monarch. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service there were 588 London–U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels. There have been a succession of newer transatlantic cable systems. All recent systems have used fiber optic transmission, and a self-healing ring topology. Late in the 20th century, communications satellites lost most of their North Atlantic telephone traffic to these low cost, high capacity, low latency cables.
average cost of assisted living in virginia	Prices for Assisted Living in Richmond, VA ranged from $2,000 - $5,250 per month. The average cost of Assisted Living in the Richmond area in 2014 was found to be $4,018 per month. “When inquiring about the cost of assisted living, it is important to ask what amenities are included, and compare it with what you’re currently paying for electric or other utilities,” says Ross. Extensive article series aims to help seniors and their families evaluate the costs of assisted living in their city. The average cost of Assisted Living in the Richmond area in 2014 was found to be $4,018 per month.Cost of Virginia Assisted Living Facilities. According to the 2015 Genworth Financial cost of care survey, the average cost of assisted living in Virginia is $3,933 per month. The monthly base rate for Virginia assisted living is typically higher when compared to neighboring states. Virginia is also more expensive compared to the national average. This cost is the base cost for a one-bedroom assisted living unit in Virginia. Additional fees beyond the base rate may apply. If built after 1996, an assisted living facility must provide a minimum of 100 square feet of living space, and no more than two residents may share a room. If built prior to 1996, up to four residents may share a room and at least 80 square feet of living space is required per resident.
explain how meiosis generates variation in gametes	Sexual reproduction is able to generate genetic variation in offspring because the process of meiosis randomly shuffles genes across chromosomes and then randomly separates half of those chromosomes into each gamete. The two gametes then randomly fuse to form a new organism. Genetic variation is one of the keys to evolutionary fitness. This is made possible because reproductive cells undergo meiosis, which is the process in which one cell divides twice to produce four sperm or four eggs. Independent Assortment. The second way that meiosis generates genetic diversity is that each individual chromosome goes into one of four different gametes. A gamete is a sperm or an egg cell. Meiosis in a normal human cell that has 46 chromosomes produces four gametes that each has 23 chromosomes.Genetic variation is increased by meiosis. During fertilisation, 1 gamete from each parent combines to form a zygote. Because of recombination and independent assortment in meiosis, each gamete contains a different set of DNA. This produces a unique combination of genes in the resulting zygote. Independent assortment is the process where the chromosomes move randomly to separate poles during meiosis. A gamete will end up with 23 chromosomes after meiosis, but independent assortment means that each gamete will have 1 of many different combinations of chromosomes.
what is a chocoholic?	Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate. Although cocoa originated in the Americas, today Western Africa produces almost two-thirds of the world's cocoa, with Cote côte'D ivoire growing almost half of. it Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this sweet chocolate, and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.A chocoholic is a person who craves or compulsively consumes chocolate. There is some medical evidence to support the existence of actual addiction to chocolate. However, the term is mostly used loosely or humorously to describe a person who is inordinately fond of chocolate. The word chocoholic was first used in 1968 according to Merriam-Webster. It is a portmanteau of  chocolate  and  alcoholic . 'Chocoholism' is quite common. In studies of food cravings, chocolate and chocolate confectioneries almost always top the list of foods people say they crave. The essential components of addiction are intense craving for something, loss of control over the use of it, and continued use despite negative consequences. Studies have shown that people can exhibit all three of these components in relation to food, particularly food that contains sugar or fat.
what is slr digital camera mean	Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: SLR stands for Single Lens Reflex. This dates back to film camera days to a degree. Rather than having a seperate viewfinder, an SLR camera used a mirror system to reflect light to the viewfinder, snapping out of view when you want to expose the frame. In the digital world, you generally have a live preview option, along with an optical viewfinder that was slightly off of the actual lens. A D-SLR camera (Digital-SLR) generally lacks a realtime LCD preview, since the mirror is in the way, although newer DSLR cameras do offer the ability to offer the traditional preview like a standard digital.A digital single-lens reflex camera (also called a digital SLR or DSLR) is a digital camera combining the optics and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film. The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design, light travels through the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either the viewfinder or the image sensor. The alternative would be to have a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term single lens for this design. By using only one lens, the viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not perceptibly differ from what is captured by the camera's sensor.
normal output per hour	If we were to base the normal urine output to an average adult person, then we could expect to have a result that is 0.5ml/kg/hr. This would give us a rough estimation of about 30 to 40 ml per hour. For children, the output rate is about 1ml/kg/hr. As for adults, some references do consider the same rate of urine output with children. This is because the rate 0.5ml/kg/hr is already considered the low normal amount. If we were to total the urine output in a day, then we could expect to have at least 1.5 liters per day. Nevertheless, it is more advisable to have more fluid intake in order to increase the volume of our output. As for women, an output of 2 liters is considered normal while men can even go as much as 3You are less than the normal urine output per hour if you're producing less than 400ml of urine in a day. This condition is usually different from anuria in which you produce less than 50ml urine in a day. You may experience this situation for many different reasons. A normal person urinates anywhere between 800 and 2,000 ml per day. It means your normal urine output per hour should be anywhere between 33.3 and 83.3 ml. If it's not within this range, there's something wrong. However, you need to ensure that you're drinking no less than 2 liters of fluid per day. These numbers may change a bit considering your unique circumstance
how long do i have to leave US if i was given voluntary departure	Answer: A judge who grants your request for voluntary departure (“VR”) request is likely to give you either 60 or 120 days in which to leave the United States. The exact number depends upon the point in the proceedings at which you make your request. You will have to “concede removability” (admit that you do not have a right to remain in the U.S.), request no relief from removal (that is, not separately claim a remedy such as asylum or cancellation of removal), waive (give up) any right to appeal, and have no aggravated felonies on your criminal record.However, failure to leave the country within the 60 to 120 days granted for voluntary departure carries far more severe consequences than those accompanying an involuntary order of removal. In addition to a $5,000 monetary fine, you are also barred for up to ten years from being granted any form of relief. Further, the voluntary departure order becomes a removal order if you fail to post the required voluntary departure bond within 5 days of the order or once the 60 days expires. However, with post-conclusion voluntary departure, you wait until after the removal proceedings have ended, or concluded, to leave. Unlike pre-conclusion voluntary departure, those who request post-conclusion voluntary departure at the end of removal proceedings must pay a $500 bond and have only 60 days to leave.
what does metamucil do to stool	metamucil. Metamucil is a fiber supplement made from psyllium. It is designed to add bulk to the stool and so help waste travel smoothly through the digestive tract. It may be marketed as a bulk laxative because it adds bulk to the stool. Psyllium, the main ingredient in Metamucil, is a soluble plant fiber. If you are gluten intolerant then it is worth noting that the Metamucil powder and capsules are gluten-free, but Metamucil wafers contain gluten (one of the ingredients is wheat flour). This went on for five days of me sticking with the Metamucil. At one point I considered going to hospital because the pain caused by gas was so severe! Finally in desperation I took a stimulant laxative-actually, one didn't do it. I had to take a second one the next day, and then the problem was finally resolved.Photo Credit KathyKafka/iStock/Getty Images. Metamucil is a fiber supplement that helps relieve constipation and keeps you regular. It makes increasing your fiber intake easier, since it comes in a variety of forms, including chewable wafers, powder, capsules and others. Avoid having loose stools after taking your Metamucil supplement by gradually increasing your intake each day. Since Metamucil conveniently comes in powder forms, you can easily control the amount of fiber you consume. Add a small amount, such as 1/2 tsp., and see how you feel.
what is qtl	Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis is a statistical method that links two types of information—phenotypic data (trait measurements) and genotypic data (usually molecular markers)—in an attempt to explain the genetic basis of variation in complex traits (Falconer & Mackay, 1996; Kearsey, 1998; Lynch & Walsh, 1998). A meta-analysis of extensive data in pigs and dairy found that QTL effects were skewed towards fewer QTL with large effects (Hayes and Goddard 2001). Orr (2001) addresses the question of defining and distinguishing between large and small effects. As with all statistical analyses, sample size is a critical factor.A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a section of DNA (the locus) that correlates with variation in a phenotype (the quantitative trait). The QTL typically is linked to, or contains, the genes that control that phenotype. QTLs are mapped by identifying which molecular markers (such as SNPs or AFLPs) correlate with an observed trait. This is often an early step in identifying and sequencing the actual genes that cause the trait variation. The principle for QTL mapping is: 1) The Likelihood can be calculated for a given set of parameters (particularly QTL effect and QTL position) given the observed data on phenotypes and marker genotypes. 2) The estimates for the parameters are those where the likelihood are highest.
what type of food do they eat in fiji	FOOD. Fiji is famous for their seafood. Their fish, prawn, lobster and cray cuisines are a culinary creator's dream. If you have the chance, try the KOKODA (pron: CORE-CONDAA). It is fresh fish marinated in freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice and left to cook for several hours. Made with the freshest of ingredients, these curries are unlike many of the curries from the Indian Sub-continent. They have a unique Fijian flavour and are a delight to eat. Remember to ask for mild or medium. There is a variety of foods to eat in Fiji together with everything that you're used to at home. Be adventurous and try their local cuisine. You will be pleasantly surprised as your tastebuds experience the sumptuous flavour sensations of the Fijian islandFiji Food. Traditional Fijian food is a wonderful amalgam of fresh, local ingredients found in the tropics and the traditional preparations and cooking methods passed down the generations. Coconut, fish, rice, taro, sweet potatoes, cassava and breadfruit are the main components in local Fijian dishes. Chinese food is very popular in Fiji as well, and Chinese restaurants can be found in many villages, towns and cities. Kim's Paak Kum Loong Restaurant in Levuku is famous for its Sunday evening buffet, and Chopsticks Restaurant in Nadi is a local, traditional dive that is preferred amongst the local Chinese.
sheetrock installed cost	Labor Costs for Sheetrock Installation. The cost of paying by the hour to have sheetrock installed can vary, according to what the local labor market will bear. You might also pay an additional fee if your carpenter is part of the local union -- known as a union wage -- which can range from $50 to $100 per hour. A 200-square-foot sheetrock project typically takes three hours for a carpenter to install, meaning the labor cost for the carpenter will range from $150 to $300. In addition to the cost of the sheetrock itself, you can expect to pay for ancillary materials such as tape, fasteners and top compound. The fasteners used are specialized drywall screws that usually go for $6 per pound with 300 screws in each pound.1 Lastly, the tape used to cover the joints between the sheet rock costs only $4.50 for every 150 feet, and a single roll should complete this project; and. 2  The Labor-At HouseFlippingHelper.com it states that the homeowner who pays roughly $25 in total costs per sheet of drywall is getting a cheaper price. 1 These will be sheets sized at 4'x8' and cost around $9 each. 2  This means that roughly 20 sheets are required for this project, which will cost around $180 total. 3  The Materials-hanging drywall means the use of special 1 1/4 drywall screws. 4  These are sold by the pound and contain around 300 screws in each pound.

causes of dizziness and vertigo	Common causes of dizziness include inner-ear disorders, medications, and alcohol. Dizziness is often a result of vertigo. It can also be caused by a problem in the inner ear, where balance is regulated. The most common cause of vertigo and vertigo-related dizziness is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This causes short-term dizziness when a person changes positions quickly—for instance, when sitting up in bed. Dizziness is not a disease but a symptom of other disorders. Vertigo and disequilibrium may cause a feeling of dizziness, but those two terms describe different symptoms. Vertigo is characterized by a feeling of spinning. Disequilibrium is a loss of balance or equilibrium. True dizziness is the feeling of lightheadedness or nearly faintingDizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion.
why do cats hiss at their owners	A hissing cat is basically trying to frighten away whatever or whoever he's hissing at. Hissing is an act of defense. The cat is issuing a clear warning saying carry on approaching me at your own risk.. Snakes are one of the most deadly and feared animals. Some cat behavior experts believe that cats hissing came about through mimicry of snakes and has evolved as a feline defense mechanism. It's easy to spot the similarities here... So why do cats hiss and mimic snakes, you may well ask. A cat that's hissing is trying to frighten whatever it's hissing at. This usually happens either because it's scared of being attacked, so is trying to face off the would-be attacker, or it's showing aggressive behavior as an act of dominanceAnswer     If your cat is hissing at strangers you can't stop your cat from hissing at them. The   only thing I can think of that would stop a cat from hiss … ing at someone is letting a cat get to know a person long enough that the cat isn't afraid of the person, and will therefore get along with him/her. They could also hiss if they feel threatened by a human or another animal. Hissing is their way of showing their anger or their fright. Also, when cats are angry, their fur stands up. This happens normally in the tail but if they are really scared/angry they will arch their backs and all of their fur will stand up.

how far apart should english lavender be planted	Step 3. Space lavender plants 2 feet apart in a row, unless planting large varieties which are spaced 3 feet apart. Leave 3 to 6 feet between each row of lavender plants. Water the plants immediately after planting. Lavender is a flowering shrub-like plant that is striking when planted in a border, as the background to a flower garden, or in naturalized areas of the landscaping. It has grayish-green leaves and most varieties sport long stems covered in small lavender or deep purple flowers.Varieties-Melissa Lilac, grey hedge and in some cases old english-so vera (dutch lavender clone). Big plants, with large spreads, and tall flowers-these can be spaced out quite far apart if you are just leaving to grow. Melissa lilac has a potential spread of up to 75cm-however would not recommend letting the plants grow that big-annual trimming recommended, as they look good as well kept small bushes. These varieties all have potential to grow quite tall, so are larger plants in the long term-they all can be kept to a border edge size by hard trimming every autumn. Planting distance should be slightly further apart than compact varieties. It is worth cheacking spread on individual listings on the popular plants website. 3 per metre, or 1 every 16-18in would be ideal, but you could go further apart, although it would look sparce for the 1st year or so
what are javelinas animal kingdom	Javelina are members of the peccary family. There are actually three species of peccaries that range from the Southwestern United States south to central South America. The only species found in the United States is the collared peccary, or javelina. In Texas, the javelina is found in the more arid or semi-arid parts of the state, with most occurring in the South Texas brush country, the Trans-Pecos' desert grasslands, and the Edwards Plateau's oak-juniper woodlands. Interactions between people and species such as deer, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, turkey, and javelina continue to increase as development expands into previously unoccupied areas. One of the most least understood, and often feared animals that individuals come into contact with is the javelina.The collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) is a species of mammal in the family Tayassuidae found in North, Central, and South America. They are commonly referred to as javelina, saino saíno or, baquiro báquiro although these terms are also used to describe other species in. the family Collared peccaries are diurnal creatures that live in groups of up to 50 individuals, averaging between six and 9 members. They frequently sleep at night in burrows, often under the roots of trees, but sometimes they can be found in caves or under logs. The collared peccary (javelina) are not totally diurnal.
where are mineral oil lubricants used	Mineral Oil Uses. Mineral oil, also known as liquid petroleum, is a by-product of the crude oil that is obtained in the distillation of petroleum, to produce gasoline and other petroleum-based products. It transpires as a tasteless, odorless (when cold), transparent, colorless, and oily liquid that is insoluble in both water and alcohol. It is often used as heat transfer oil by electric space heaters. Mineral oil is also used as a fluid in hydraulic machinery and vehicle, as it is non-compressible. Light mineral oil is used as a lubricant in textile industries and even used as a jute batching oil. For Cleaning. Mineral oil works wonders in cleaning heavy oil stains, by diluting and liquefying the other oils, thereby rendering them more accessible to detergents® LubKlear™ White mineral Oils meet the requirements of U.S. Regulations 21 CFR 172.878 and 178.3620 for direct and indirect food contact.

how to stop developing cold	2) Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you blow your nose, wash your hands before touching your mouth or eyes. If you cough, wash your hands before touching your eyes or nose. If you need to rub your eyes (itchy eyes) try to wash your hands first. The key here is that you CAN give a cold back to yourself. 3) It’s okay to blow your nose. It is your body’s way of cleaning debris and foreign objects (viruses and/or its byproducts) out of your system. 4) Take Vitamins. If you don’t want a cold you probably don’t want to intentionally expose yourself to people who have a cold. IF you must, wash your hands afterwards if you touched them (shaking hands) and it wouldn’t hurt to make sure you take your vitamins that day. 6) Eat healthy, energizing food.If you kill cold germs on your hands before you transfer them to your nose or eyes, you stop a cold before it can start. Few of us can wash our hands as often as needed, though, so be sure to follow these other strategies as well: Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes and nose. Drink a lot of water. And tea, and juice, and clear broth. Fluids help your body heal from a cold by loosening congestion and preventing dehydration. Water, juice, clear broth, or warm lemon water with honey are the best fluids to rely on; alcohol, coffee, and caffeinated sodas only make dehydration worse.
what is the threshold for charitable donation audit	In order to claim a deduction for charitable donations, you have to itemize deductions on Schedule A, Form 1040. You need to enter dollar amounts for both cash and noncash contributions. If you donated clothing, household goods or other items valued at more than $500, you'll also need to complete Section A of Form 8283. If your deductions are greater than 50% of your AGI, you can carry over the remaining deduction to the next tax year. Keep in mind, however, that the IRS may raise an eyebrow if your charitable donations are disproportionately high compared to your income.April 2015 Higher audit threshold for charities In March 2015, the government announced changes to charity law that allow more charities to become audit exempt. The changes apply to financial years ending on or after 31 March 2015. The threshold for the audit requirement is now £1,000,000 of income. If your charity has income between £500,000 and £1,000,000 and gross assets below £3,260,000 you may no longer require an audit. Previously this only applied to charities with less than £500,000 income. For charity groups, the audit threshold has also increased to £1,000,000. For charities that are now exempt from audit, they will still need an independent examination by a qualified accountant. All charities with more than £25,000 income must have an independent examination.

what are the tonsils of the brain	Chiari malformation is a congenital (i.e. present at birth) structural problem at the base of the skull that affects the brain and spinal cord. In fact it is not a malformation of the brain at all. More accurately, the lower portion of the skull, the portion known as the posterior fossa, is too small to accomodate the lower portion of the brain. As a result, a portion of the cerebellum called the tonsils is forced to protrude into the spinal column. Types of Chiari Malformation (CM). Type I involves the extension of the cerebellar tonsils (the lower part of the cerebellum) into the foramen magnum.There are usually no other associated malformations of the brain. This is the only form of Chiari malformation to present in adult life.The flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum which can also be confused for the cerebellar tonsils, is one of three lobes that make up the overall composition of the cerebellum. The cerebellum consists of three anatomical and functional lobes: anterior lobe, posterior lobe, and flocculonodular lobe. A Type I Chiari malformation is a congenital anomaly of the brain in which the cerebellar tonsils are elongated and pushed down through the opening of the base of the skull (see foramen magnum), blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as it exits through the medial and lateral apertures of the fourth ventricle.

how long does it take to do a glass tile backsplash	With a proper installation tile backsplash will last for many years. Tile is very long lasting product and it can easily serve its decoration function on a backsplash for 25 – 30 years or more. In majority of cases it won’t be a problem with longevity, but with appearance. Let say in 10 – 15 years you might just want to replace old fashion backsplash with some new and modern product. The prices for getting a new tile backsplash installed will depend on which product you will use and who will perform installation. There is a very huge price range for backsplash tile. Some products might cost as low as $1 s/f and some $20 s/f plus there will be additional cost for tile adhesive and grout if necessary. For the installation of tile backsplash and apply grout prepare to pay $10 - $20Project size. It is very uncommon that basic installation of 30 square feet marble tile backsplash will last longer than one day. But 8 hours might be insufficient time for a single tile setter to complete installation of 6” x 6” travertine tile and apply grout on over 55 ft 2 backsplash. Additional couple hours will be necessary for grout application and cleaning the job site. But complex backsplash installation with incorporation of different types of tile and creating unique design could be a very time consuming project which might last a few days to complete.
list of food for blood type a positive	Blood Type A Menu. On the blood type diet, a good breakfast if you're type A is whole-grain cereal, such as steel-cut oatmeal, along with fresh mixed fruit. Typical snacks for type A are foods such as fruit, nuts, seeds, rice cakes and peanut butter. For lunch, it's typical to have a large, hearty salad with lots of fresh vegetables. The Blood Type Diet Premise. D’Adamo theorizes that your blood type provides a distinctive marker for which foods are best for you, based on the diet of your ancestors with the same blood type. This means a nutritious diet for one blood type may include different foods than a nutritious diet for anotherThe antigens present in blood determine the blood type of a person. Antigens, A and B are present on the blood cell's surface and works as markers in the body. People with blood type o positive have an Rh antigen as well as A and B antigens present in the plasma. Type O is the most common blood type and is often sought out for blood donation as well because type O blood can be donated to people of any blood types without fear of rejection. O Positive Blood Type Diet. Many people wonder whether personality is influenced by blood type or not. Well, the blood group you belong to can give a lot of insight about you. Different lectins present in supplements and foods stimulate your cells based on your blood group.
what food does vitamin iron come from	Iron-Rich Foods. Eating a variety of iron-rich foods on a daily basis can help you meet your daily iron requirements. Meats, poultry, fish and seafood are good choices because the iron in animal-based foods is absorbed better than iron from plant-based foods. Other foods that contain iron include iron-fortified cereals and oatmeal, soybeans, lentils, kidney beans, other legumes and spinach. Eating foods rich in vitamin C—such as citrus fruits--can increase iron absorption in your body, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements. Examples of vitamins include A, C, D, E, K and the B vitamins; examples of minerals include iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, phosphorous, selenium, zinc, copper and iodine.Iron is an essential mineral, with several important roles in the body. For example, it helps to make red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. A lack of iron can lead to iron deficiency anaemia. Good sources of iron include: 1  liver. 2  meat. 3  beans. 4  nuts. 5  dried fruit – such as dried apricots. 6  wholegrains – such as brown rice. 7  fortified breakfast cereals. 8  soybean flour. 9  most dark-green leafy vegetables – such as watercress and curly kale.

why is the connective tissue important	Connective Tissue A really diverse group of tissues: Connective tissue is the most diverse of the four tissue types with a wide variety of functions. It ranges in consistency from the gel-like softness of areolar connective tissue to the hardness of bone. A really diverse group of tissues. Connective tissue is the most diverse of the four tissue types with a wide variety of functions. It ranges in consistency from the gel-like softness of areolar connective tissue to the hardness of bone. Blood is also a connective tissue.Connective tissue (blue) is seen supporting the epithelium (purple). Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system the outer membranes, the meninges, that cover the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. All connective tissue apart from blood and lymph consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells. (Not all authorities include blood or lymph as connective tissue.) Blood and lymph lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.
what does the muscles of respiration do	In human physiology, the muscles of respiration are those muscles that contribute to inhalation and exhalation, by aiding in the expansion and contraction of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm and, to a lesser extent, the intercostal muscles drive respiration during quiet breathing. Additional 'accessory muscles of respiration' are typically only used under conditions of high metabolic demand (e.g. exercise) or respiratory dysfunction (e.g. an asthma attack). These muscles are attached between the ribs and are important in manipulating the width of the rib cage. There are three layers of intercostal muscles. The external intercostal muscles are most significant in respiration. These have fibres that are angled obliquely downward and forward from rib to rib.Breathing is an active process-requiring the contraction of skeletal muscles. The primary muscles of respiration include the external intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) and the diaphragm (a sheet of muscle located between the thoracic & abdominal cavities). As the external intercostals & diaphragm contract, the lungs expand. The expansion of the lungs causes the pressure in the lungs (and alveoli) to become slightly negative relative to atmospheric pressure. As a result, air moves from an area of higher pressure (the air) to an area of lower pressure (our lungs & alveoli).

how long does it take for amitriptyline to leave your system	Best Answer: Normal doses of the drug are metabolzed by the liver then the by-products are excreted in the urine. Its elimination half-life varies from 10 to 50 hours, with an average of 15 hours. One-half to one-third of a normal dose is excreted within 24 hours. Using that info, she should be drug-free anywhere from 6 to 20 days. That is of course if her liver function OK. She will probably have residual nervous system effects for some time. Hard to predict.

what does the ostriches wings do	The largest and heaviest living bird, the ostrich is flightless and instead is built for running. With its powerful legs, the ostrich can sprint in short bursts up to 43 mph (70 kph), and can maintain a steady speed of 31 mph (50 kph). Credit: Stockxpert. Feeding them got them used tome as their mama.. After three years, when the ostriches were full-grown, thescientists video-recorded them as they raced down nearly 1,000-foot (300-meter)stretches outdoors. They found the ostriches used wings as sophisticatedair-rudders for rapid braking, turning and zigzag maneuvers.To show dominance, an ostrich holds its head up high and lifts its wings and tail feathers; to show submission, the head, wings, and tail droop down. Unlike most birds’ feathers, ostrich feathers are loose, soft, and smooth. They don’t hook together the way feathers of other birds do, giving ostriches a shaggy look. The feathers can also get soaked in the rain, because ostriches do not have the special gland many birds have to waterproof their feathers while preening. Actually, that’s a myth: ostriches do not bury their heads in the sand! When an ostrich senses danger and cannot run away, it flops to the ground and remains still, with its head and neck flat on the ground in front of it. Because the head and neck are lightly colored, they blend in with the color of the soil.
what is nevis famous for	Saint Kitts and Nevis is known for a number of musical celebrations including Carnival (18 December to 3 January on Saint Kitts). The last week in June features the St Kitts Music Festival, while the week-long Culturama on Nevis lasts from the end of July into early August.

what type plant is cantaloupes	Soil pH influences the availability of nutrients in the soil, the activities of soil microorganisms and, subsequently, plant growth, yield and cantaloupe quality. Maintaining soil pH in the 6.0 to 6.5 range is important for cantaloupe production. Water is a critical component in the production of cantaloupes and specialty melons in Georgia. Most melon crops are potentially deep-rooted (3 to 4 feet); however, in Georgia soils the effective rooting depth is generally much less.Cantaloupe (also cantelope, cantaloup, muskmelon (India and the United States), mushmelon, rockmelon, sweet melon, honeydew, Persian melon, or spanspek (South Africa)) refers to a variety of Cucumis melo, a species in the family Cucurbitaceae.

how much does it cost to employ someone	added by Peter 1852 days ago under Employment | Tags: Employing people, True Cost of an Employee. You might think this is a simple question to answer. If you need a new employee it should be straight forward to work out the hourly rate or the annual salary…….. and bingo! Suddenly the picture starts to look quite different. That £15,000 a year you started with is growing bigger. It’s no longer the £7.80 per hour (for a 37 hour week) that you budgeted. In fact, it will be almost double that amount. A £15,000 per year employee is likely to cost almost £28,000 (that’s £14.51 per hour). And if you offer company benefits (even simple ones like free tea or coffee) the cost will be higher.Vacation is another cost but is subsumed in the basic salary. The costs to this point (basic salary, employment taxes and benefits) are typically in the 1.25 to 1.4 times base salary range-e.g. the cost range for a $50,000/year employee might $62,500 to $70,000. Space. Unless you are hiring traveling salespeople, you need to provide some physical space to house the new employee. Basic salary and employment taxes are a minimum-in most cases you will need to provide some benefits. Typical benefits for a $50,000 salaried employee include life insurance ($150) and health coverage ($2,000-$3,000 for single persons; $6,000-$7,2000 for families-http://www.ahrq.gov).

most of the insulin manufactured today to treat diabetes is produced by	As a consequence, insulin is used medically to treat some forms of diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 1 diabetes depend on external insulin (most commonly injected subcutaneously) for their survival because the hormone is no longer produced internally. Patients with type 2 diabetes are often insulin resistant and, because of such resistance, may suffer from a relative insulin deficiency. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may eventually require insulin if dietary modifications or other medications fail to control blood glucose levels adequately. Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available.Background. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood and is required for the body to function normally. Insulin is produced by cells in the pancreas, called the islets of Langerhans. The most severe type, known as Type I or juvenile-onset diabetes, is when the body does not produce any insulin. Type I diabetics usually inject themselves with different types of insulin three to four times daily. Dosage is taken based on the person's blood glucose reading, taken from a glucose meter.

what atoms are contained in our food	So, if an atom had six protons, it should also have six electrons. The element with six protons and six electrons is called carbon. Carbon is found in abundance in the sun, stars, comets, atmospheres of most planets, and the food we eat. Coal is made of carbon; so are diamonds. Some kinds of atoms have loosely attached electrons. All matter is made up of atoms, and atoms are made up of smaller particles. The three main particles making up an atom are the proton, the neutron and the electron. Electrons spin around the center, or nucleus, of atoms, in the same way the moon spins around the earth. The nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons.Fats and ethanol have the greatest amount of food energy per mass, 37 and 29 kJ/g (8.8 and 6.9 kcal/g), respectively. Proteins and most carbohydrates have about 17 kJ/g (4.1 kcal/g). The differing energy density of foods (fat, alcohols, carbohydrates and proteins) lies mainly in their varying proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates that are not easily absorbed, such as fiber, or lactose in lactose-intolerant individuals, contribute less food energy. (Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins comprise ninety percent of the dry weight of foods. ) Organisms derive food energy from carbohydrates, fats and proteins as well as from organic acids, polyols, and ethanol present in the diet.

what is the meaning of humpty dumpty	However, it is a very old rhyme and goes back much earlier than this. Humpty Dumpty was a common nickname, used in 15th century England, to describe large people. This had led to many ideas as to who, or what, the Humpty Dumpty in the nursery rhyme really was. The idea that 'Humpty Dumpty' was a powerful cannon, used during the English Civil War (1642-49), is one of the ideas taken most seriously. Cannons, at this time, were very heavy and moving them, even the smallest, took many men. One says that Humpty Dumpty referred to Charles I himself-the Humpty Dumpty of England. He was toppled by the Puritan majority in Parliament (the great fall). The King's army (Cavaliers) could not give his power back and Charles I was executed.10. Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty was first printed in 1810. At the time, a humpty dumpty was a clumsy person, so the nursery rhyme was meant as a riddle. It doesn’t actually state that Humpty Dumpty is an egg, so the aim of the reader is to guess what he really is. Of course there is not a person who knows the tale these days that doesn’t know he is an egg. There is speculation that the nursery rhyme had an underlying meaning – in which Humpty Dumpty represents King Richard III of England and the wall his horse. Others have suggested that it refers to the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey at the hand of King Henry VIII.

In general, the higher the lift capacity, the more you can expect to pay: 1  Two-post and four-post lifts with a 10,000 capacity range in price from about $1,500 to $3,500. 2  For 14,000-pound capacity models, budget $3,000 to $6,000. 3  In-ground lifts usually cost $6,000 to $10,000.A typical, straight line chair lift will cost between $3,000 and $4,000, depending on power source and amenities. Installing a special stair lift, such as ones installed on a spiral stairway or 90 degree turn stairway, may increase the cost to as much as $12,000. These prices include installation; most companies will include installation as part of the price of the chair lift. An average 6-person elevator, with shaft installed, can cost up to $20,000. This does not include labor costs to clear room for an elevator shaft. Depending on how much labor is needed to clear room for an elevator shaft, the price can double up to $40,000 to return your home to its normal state.
what is a mook	Report Abuse. Mook is a slang term with several different meanings. The term mook or jamook is Italian American slang for an annoying, stupid, undesirable person. Often simply meaning that the person is contemptible or below your consideration. The term Mook sparks a brawl in Martin Scorsese's film Mean Streets. In some cases, mook can refer to a nondescript, unspecial person, such as some mook from the block.. Mook is the Japanese publishing industry's generic name for quarterly or irregularly published large-format softcover publications having more pages than a typical magazine, yet less pages than a proper bookMook is used as either a humorous (knucklehead) or derrogative (jerk) expression of humanistic imperfection or inappropriatness, such as to describe a person's clumsiness or loudness. The word is most often heard in the NE region of the United States, particularly New York City, Atlantic City, Philadelphia, and Boston.

The word mook is best applied with a Bronx, Philly, or New Jersey shore accent.
different kind of diseases from nutritional	In most of the cases the excessive intake of some nutrients can cause acute poisoning. Nutritional diseases and disorders can lead to many problems. Lack of appetite, constipation, eye ach, weakness and many others are symptoms of food and nutrition diseases. There are many types of nutrition diseases including. Nutritional diseases treatment depends upon the diseases (originated due to lack of nutrition in diet) and their symptoms. Patients are advised to take proper diet having lots of nutrition. They are also advised to take exercises properly. Nutrition diseases are diseases in humans that are directly or indirectly caused by a lack of essential nutrients in the diet. Nutrition diseases are commonly associated with chronic malnutrition. Additionally, conditions like obesity from overeating can also cause, or contribute to, serious health problemsDifferent types of deficiency diseases can be caused by insufficient intake and usage of iron or protein, and there are other diseases that occur when a person's diet lacks or is too low in a certain vitamin. Among the most well known of these are beriberi, pellagra, pernicious anemia, scurvy, rickets, and osteomalacia. Generally, such diseases can be treated successfully and even cured by ensuring that the nutritional needs of the body are met on a daily basis unless a person is fasting.
what the layers called for pericardium	serous pericardium the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is in contact with the heart and roots of the great vessels. Called also epicardium. serous pericardium. the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium. the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is intimately attached to the heart and roots of the great vessels.The pericardium (from the Greek περί, around and κάρδιον, heart) is a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels. The pericardial sac has two layers, a serous layer and a fibrous layer. It encloses the pericardial cavity which contains pericardial fluid. The pericardium fixes the heart to the mediastinum, gives protection against infection, and provides the lubrication for the heart. The serous pericardium, in turn, is divided into two layers, the parietal pericardium, which is fused to and inseparable from the fibrous pericardium, and the visceral pericardium, which is part of the epicardium. Both of these layers function in lubricating the heart to prevent friction during heart activity.
what is a urine clinitest	The Chemstrip glucose pad is only specific for detection of increased levels of glucose and will not detect increased levels of other reducing substances (galactose, fructose, lactose, pentose). A Copper reduction test (Clinitest) detects some hereditary disorders which may be present in pediatric patients. 1. Protection against exposure to light, heat, and ambient moisture is mandatory to guard against altered reagent activity. 2. Clinitest is not specific for glucose and will react with sufficient quantities of any reducing substance in the urine (lactose, fructose, galactose, and pentoses). 3. Failure to observe the reaction at all times can lead to erroneously low results if the “pass-through” phenomenon is missedClinitest, a trademark for reagent tablets used to test for the presence of reducing sugars, such as glucose, in the urine.

how much to waterproof a bathroom	1 Bathroom walls should be waterproofed to a height of 150mm. 2  If the bathroom floor contains or is made of timber or is on the 2nd floor or higher, it must be thoroughly waterproofed. 3  The area over the shower enclosure step and down to the floor must be waterproofed to a height of 100mm. If waterproofing is part of their service, make sure they hold a valid waterproofer's license if needed and issue a certificate of compliance upon completion of the job. Bathroom waterproofing can cost as little as $35 per square metre, but that is the low end of the scale. In general, professional waterproofing costs between $500 and $750 for an average bathroom. If the waterproofing is done in more than one bathroom or as part of a complete bathroom renovation, the cost may be lower1 The walls need to be waterproofed up to 150mm. 2  If the bathroom floor is made of or contains wood or if the bathroom is on the second story or higher, the whole floor must be waterproofed. 3  Over the step down to the floor should be waterproofed to 100mm. You will need a qualified and licensed waterproofer to waterproof your bathroom. While you can get a tradesperson who specialises exclusively in waterproofing, in some instances other tradespeople may be licensed or certified waterproofers too. Plumbers, for example, are often qualified waterproofers as well.
what do walloon call flemish	Walloon language. Walloon (Walon in Walloon) is a Romance language that was spoken as a primary language in large portions (70%) of Wallonia in Belgium, in some villages of Northern France (near Givet) and in the northeast part of Wisconsin until the mid 20th century. Walloon was the predominant language of the Walloon people until the beginning of the 20th century, although they had a passing knowledge of French. Since that time, the use of French has spread to the extent that now only 15% of the Walloon population speak their ancestral language.[walɔ̃] ; Walloon: Walons) are a French-speaking people who live in Belgium, principally in Wallonia. Walloons are a distinctive ethnic community within Belgium. Important historical and anthropological criteria (religion, language, traditions, folklore) bind Walloons to the French people. More generally, the term also refers to the inhabitants of the Walloon Region. They speak regional languages such as Walloon (with Picard in the West and Lorrain in the South). Walloons are the descendants of Gallo-Romans with Germanic Frankish admixture. The border is clear (...)

what are good food sources for magnesium	Print. The sources of magnesium include food, water, and supplements. While clearly a “good” source of magnesium is one that is readily available and easily absorbed, most experts recommend a combination of sources, taking advantage of both dietary magnesium and absorbable magnesium supplements. Traditionally, foods highest in magnesium content are green vegetables, whole grain cereals, nuts and beans, and seafood. According to USDA food charts (see a complete chart of magnesium rich foods), the five foods with the highest magnesium per typical serving are: 1  Halibut. 2  Mackeral. 3  Boiled spinach. 4  Bran breakfast cereal.Try to include as many foods rich in magnesium in your diet as possible, and supplement the shortfall with AlgaeCal, a natural source of magnesium, calcium and many other minerals you need. Below is a list of foods that are a good source of magnesium. List of Magnesium Rich Foods. Magnesium Rich Food Sources. Green vegetables such as spinach are good sources of magnesium because the center of the chlorophyll molecule (which gives green vegetables their color) contains magnesium. Some beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and whole, unrefined grains are also good sources of magnesium. You should note that refined grains are generally low in magnesium. When white flour is processed, the magnesium rich germ and bran are removed
which location is in the southern hemisphere	The continents making up the Southern Hemisphere include all of Antarctica, around 1/3 of Africa, most of South America and nearly all of Australia. Because of the large presence of water in the Southern Hemisphere, climate in the Earth's southern half is more mild overall than the Northern Hemisphere. In general, water heats and cools more slowly than land so water near any land area usually has a moderating effect on the land's climate. The Coriolis Effect and the Southern Hemisphere. An important component of physical geography in the Southern Hemisphere is the Coriolis Effect and the specific direction that objects are deflected in Earth's southern half. In the southern hemisphere any object moving over the Earth's surface deflects to the left.Australia/Oceania, like North America, is located in only two hemispheres. All of Australia is located south of the equator, and east of the Prime Meridian. This means that Australia/Oceania is located in the Southern and Eastern Hemispheres. North of Australia, lies the largest continent in the world, Asia. Most of Asia is located in the Northern Hemisphere. Antarctica is also a part of three hemispheres. Antarctica is located entirely in the Southern Hemisphere, but the Prime Meridian runs through the continent. Therefore, Antarctica is also located in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.
what is overinflated lungs	A recent chest X-ray showed that I have hyperinflated lungs. Hyperinflated lungs can be caused by obstructions in the passages that deliver air to your lung tissue. Air gets trapped within the lung and causes it to overinflate. Hyperinflation can also occur when the air sacs in your lungs become less elastic, which interferes with the expulsion of air from your lungs. One of the most common causes of hyperinflated lungs is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — a disorder that includes emphysema. In some cases, lungs may appear hyperinflated on X-rays for reasons unrelated to lung function. If you aren't experiencing shortness of breath, there's probably nothing to worry about. However, if it isn't clear what is causing the hyperinflation, your doctor may recommend additional testing. With.Hyperinflation of the lungs is a term used to describe excessive, large or heightened increase in lung tissues. Hyper in the medical field means excessive. Understanding the causes and the symptoms of lung hyperinflation helps prompt individuals to seek treatment. COPD. People diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are also prone to hyperinflation of the lung. COPD is often common in individuals diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. According to the Mayo Clinic, COPD is one of the leading causes of death around the world.
what are the four different types of bonds	Government Bonds In general, fixed-income securities are classified according to the length of time before maturity. These are the three main categories: Bills-debt securities maturing in less than one year. Notes-debt securities maturing in one to 10 years. Bonds-debt securities maturing in more than 10 years. Marketable securities from the U.S. government-known collectively as Treasuries-follow this guideline and are issued as Treasury bonds, Treasury notes and Treasury bills (T-bills). Technically speaking, T-bills aren't bonds because of their short maturity.Not all atoms bond the same way, so we need to learn the different types of bonds that atoms can form. There are three (sometimes four) recognized chemical bonds; they are ionic, covalent, polar covalent, and (sometimes) hydrogen bonds. Now let’s take a look at how these atoms and molecules hold together. Bonds hold atoms and molecules of substances together. There are several different kinds of bonds; the type of bond seen in elements and compounds depends on the chemical properties as well as the attractive forces governing the atoms and molecules. The three types of chemical bonds are Ionic bonds, Covalent bonds, and Polar covalent bonds. Chemists also recognize hydrogen bonds as a fourth form of chemical bond, though their properties align closely with the other types of
what is the sun's location	The Sun (in Greek: Helios, in Latin: Sol) is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. The solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 7003136800000000000♠1,368 W/m2 (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth).Some astronomers think we might actually just have two arms, Perseus and Sagittarius. The Sun is located in the inner rim of the Orion Arm, which is thought to be an offshoot of the Sagittarius Arm. The Sun is located about 26,000 light-years away from the center of the galaxy. Before telescopes, the Milky Way just looked like a bright area in the sky, but when Galileo first turned his telescope on the region in 1610, he realized that it was actually made up of faint stars. The astronomer Harlow Shapley accurately determined where the Sun is in the MIlky Way in the early 20th century by noticing that globular clusters were uniformly located above and below the Milky Way, but they were concentrated in the sky towards the constellation Sagittarius.
total variable cost formula	By dividing the total variable costs for a specific period by that same period's production volume will provide us with the variable cost per spark plug. For example, if the spark plug business made 500,000 units last year, its unit variable cost is $90,000 / 500,000, or $0.18. Formula of Variable Cost. The formula to calculate variable cost is: Total Variable Cost = Total Quantity of Output * Variable Cost Per Unit of Output. To recognize variable costs, it is important to understand how to categorize costs. Variable costs are those which do not remain constant, specifically when production activities fluctuate(Average fixed cost + Average variable cost) x Number of units = Total cost. For example, a company is incurring $10,000 of fixed costs to produce 1,000 units (for an average fixed cost per unit of $10), and its variable cost per unit is $3. At the 1,000-unit production level, the total cost of the production is: ($10 Average fixed cost + $3 Average variable cost) x 1,000 Units = $13,000 Total cost. There are several problems with the total cost formula, which are as follows: The total cost formula is used to derive the combined variable and fixed costs of a batch of goods or services. The formula is the average fixed cost per unit plus the average variable cost per unit, multiplied by the number of units. The calculation is:

what temperature should i cook frozen cod	1 Poaching: I like to add the fish to the cooking liquid while the liquid is room temperature. 2  I bring it to a simmer, and then turn the heat to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes. Cooking time will vary greatly depending not only on the cut of fish but also the cooking method. In general, your cod will be done when it reaches an internal temperature of 54°C (130°F), regardless of cooking method. Here are some times/temperatures that work for me: 1  Sous Vide: 10 minutes or more at 56°C, followed by a quick broiling/grilling/blow torch. 2  Baking (thick fillets): 15–20 minutes at 218°C (425°F)At 300F I bake a chicken for 1/2 hour per pound. At 350F I bake it for 20 minutes per pound. Always test it before preparing to serve it, stabbing the thigh meat, the juices s … hould run clear, and no pinkness or redness. Or with a meat thermometer it should read at least 165F. If I stuff the bird, I increase the cooking time by the weight of the stuffing. A 5 pound roaster stuffed with 2 pounds of stuffing is 7 pounds and I'll bake it for 2 2/3 to 3 1/2 hours. Think 8-10 minutes per inch of thickness, i.e. if … you have 2 pieces of 1-1/2 inch thickness and weighing about 16-20 ounces, do not cook it for any more than 20-30 minutes. Your oven should be set no high than 350 F or 160 C. Grilled cod fish is done once it starts to flake.

what color are liver flukes	The type of liver fluke endemic to our area is called Fascioloides magna. These flukes are flat, elongated, oval, and look like “leeches”. They are purple-gray in color and are found while cutting open the liver either in the packing plant or by a post-mortem examination. In the northern and northwestern regions of Minnesota the natural host of this fluke is the white-tailed deer making exposure control to this parasite difficult. When the eggs hatch, they enter snails, which then become an intermediate host. Further development of the larvae (young flukes) occurs in vegetation until ingested by cattle. The larvae then migrate from the intestine to the liver. This migration pattern can sometimes cause massive hemorrhage or blood loss in cattle.Liver flukes are parasites. They are a polyphyletic group of trematodes (phylum Platyhelminthes). Adults of liver flukes are localized in the liver of various mammals, including humans. These flatworms can occur in bile ducts, gallbladder, and liver parenchyma. They feed on blood. Adult flukes produce eggs which are passed into the intestine. It depends on two intermediate hosts (a snail and a fish) to complete its life cycle. Examples include: 1  Clonorchis sinensis (the Chinese liver fluke or the Oriental liver fluke). 2  Dicrocoelium dendriticum (lancet liver fluke). 3  Dicrocoelium hospes.

how long for mosquito larvae to hatch	For instance, Culex tarsalis, a common California (USA) mosquito, might go through its life cycle in 14 days at 70° F and take only 10 days at 80° F. On the other hand, some species have naturally adapted to go through their entire life cycle in as little as four days or as long as one month. Most eggs hatch into larvae within 48 hours; others might withstand subzero winters before hatching. Water is a necessary part of their habitat. Larva: The larva (plural-larvae) lives in the water and comes to the surface to breathe. Larvae shed (molt) their skins four times, growing larger after each molt.Mosquito Life Cycle. Mosquito, After Feedings. The length of the mosquito life cycle varies between species and is dependent upon environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture. However, the life cycle of all mosquitoes is comprised of the egg, larval, pupal and adult stages. Male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar alone, while females extract the blood of hosts in order to develop and nourish eggs. Most mosquitoes lay their eggs directly into water. Others lay their eggs near bodies of water but not within them. Eggs will hatch into larvae within 24 to 48 hours. Larvae soon grow to become approximately 5 mm in length. Most larvae breathe through air tubes. Larger larvae can be seen floating just above the surface of infested waters. 
what are placoid scales	Darkfield Digital Image Gallery Dogfish Shark Placoid Scales Dogfish sharks are small sharks belonging to one of three families: the dogfish shark family, Squalidae; the requiem shark family, Carcharhinidae; and the cat shark family, Scyliorhinidae. The green dogfish, along with several other members of the dogfish shark family, is luminescent. Scales are small plates that form part of the skin of certain animals. They provide protection from the environment and from predators. Sharks have placoid scales, bony, spiny projections with an enamel-like covering.

what phase of matter is the mantle	The inner core is solid, the outer core is liquid, and the mantle solid/plastic. This is because of the relative melting points of the different layers (nickel–iron core, silicate crust and mantle) and the increase in temperature and pressure as depth increases. The interior of Earth, similar to the other terrestrial planets, is chemically divided into layers. The mantle is a layer between the crust and the outer core. Earth's mantle is a silicate rocky shell with an average thickness of 2,886 kilometres (1,793 mi). The mantle makes up about 84% of Earth's volume. It is predominantly solid but in geological time it behaves as a very viscous fluid. The mantle encloses the hot core rich in iron and nickel, which makes up about 15% of Earth's volumeA simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air over the water is a third phase.

how does child support payments work	A child support order is a legal order that establishes a parent's periodic obligation to pay child support. A parent also may be ordered to provide health insurance or pay all or part of a child's reasonable and necessary medical expenses. A child support order is based on the specific circumstances of the parties and it states the amount owed, the frequency (weekly, monthly), where to send payments, and other terms. 1 A written agreement does not change the terms of the parent's support order. 2  If you go to the clerk of court's office and pay what you owe, you should be able to get your license back at a local DHSMV or tax collector office 2 business days after the Child Support Program receives your payment.The court order of support requires you to pay a certain amount on a weekly or monthly basis, and each week or month another installment of support becomes due. DOR's billing cycle is from the first day to the last day of every month. At the beginning of every month, DOR calculates how much support is due that month. If DOR does not receive all the payments due in the month before the billing cycle closes at the end of the month, the missed payments result in an arrears balance. This Information Sheet explains how, in some instances, the arrears balance may not be true arrears. If You Have a Weekly Child Support Obligation.
what is a refugee?	When people flee their own country and seek sanctuary in another country, they apply for asylum – the right to be recognized as a refugee and receive legal protection and material assistance. An asylum seeker must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution in his or her home country is well-founded.n internally displaced person (IDP) is a person who has been forced to flee his or her home for the same reason as a refugee, but remains in his or her own country and has not crossed an international border. Unlike refugees, IDPs are not protected by international law or eligible to receive many types of aid.A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so.

how to write project proposal	Almost any business engaged in providing goods or services will at some point have to reply to a Request for Proposal, or RFP. The biggest mistake in writing a proposal is to approach it as a fill-in-the-blank task. Sell Yourself and Your Company. Most requests for proposals aren't just looking for the cheapest provider -- clients want someone who understands their pain and will solve all of their problems. Your job is to convince them that you are that person. When writing the proposal, don't just stop at making a list. Each bullet point or deliverable should include at least some minimal language as to how you are solving their problem, or how you are best and most uniquely positioned to help them. A good sales tactic in making a proposal is to offer optionsNew or inexperienced project managers can use this generic example of a project proposal to help create and develop their own proposals. slide 1 of 8. The following project proposal outline is in a generic format so it can be applied to several kinds of circumstances and projects. It usually starts with a description of the overall approach. Then it provides details on methodology, the population being addressed, and how anticipated problems will be managed. 1.) The Project Approach Summary. Write a few short paragraphs or bullet points on your overall approach to the project.
what is malta	Malta (/ˈmɒltə/ ; [ˈmɐltɐ]), officially the Republic of Malta (Maltese: Repubblika ta' Malta), is a Southern European island country comprising an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. It lies 80 km (50 mi) south of Italy, 284 km (176 mi) east of Tunisia, and 333 km (207 mi) north of Libya. Traffic in Malta drives on the left. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union. The number of registered cars in 1990 amounted to 182,254, giving an automobile density of 582 /km 2 (1,510 /sq mi).Malta is the largest of the three major islands that constitute the Maltese archipelago. It is sometimes referred to as Valletta for statistical purposes to distinguish the main island from the entire country. Malta is in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea directly south of Italy and north of Libya. The island is 27 kilometres (17 mi) long and 14.5 kilometres (9 mi) wide, with a total area of 246 square kilometres (95 sq mi). The capital is Valletta, largest city is Qormi and the largest locality is Birkirkara. Malta is located east of its sister islands of Gozo and Comino. It lies on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a land bridge between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last Ice Age.
when there is an inadvertent return during horizontal drilling, what is the return	IF AN INADVERTENT RELEASES OCCURS 1. Notify the Ohio EPA Emergency Response hotline at (1-800-282-9378) 2. Emergency response On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) will contact on-scene personnel to determine if immediate response is warranted 3. OSC will work with company to document and assess release, and will oversee containment and clean up measures 4.Inadvertent Returns Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) is a safe, commonly used technology; however, there are challenges associated with this construction method because of varying geology along the project footprint. When using HDD, there is the possibility of having what is commonly referred to as an inadvertent return. An inadvertent return occurs when drilling mud seeps to the surface due to geology and soil qualities that create pathways along the bore path for the mud to escape. In other words, there may be an existing crack in the bedrock where the water-bentonite mix can escape. How Do We Respond to an Inadvertent Return? In accordance with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulations, Sunoco Pipeline is required to have response plans in place at all designated HDD locations to contain the drilling mud that flows to the surface in the event of an inadvertent return. Under this comprehensive plan, we will contain, remove and recycle any drilling mud that
what organ or organ system does typhoid affect	Other Body Systems Affected. From the blood, salmonella can cause several infections. In patients with sickle cell disease, salmonella can cause osteomyelitis. This bone infection usually presents with localized pain, especially when trying to move, and fever. Salmonella is a common bacterium that causes infection in humans, usually through exposure to inadequately processed foods like chicken or eggs, contaminated water, and contact with animals like reptiles and amphibians. The people affected most are usually very young or have underlying immune deficiencies.A Honor Society of Nursing (STTI) answered. Once the bacteria that causes typhoid fever is consumed, it travels from the digestive system into the blood. As the bacteria travel through the body, symptoms like high fever, headache, and overall fatigue can develop. The digestive system is also affected by the bacteria, which leads to stomach pain, diarrhea or constipation, and weight loss. The blood can carry the bacteria to other organs including the lungs, liver, gallbladder, and kidneys. Infections in these organs can cause other problems and symptoms, such as pneumonia. The most serious complication of typhoid fever is intestinal bleeding or perforation, which may develop in the third week of illness. About 5% of individuals with typhoid fever experience this complication.
what composes of corn syrup	Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose. 1 Light corn syrup is corn syrup seasoned with vanilla flavor and salt. ) 2  Light corn syrup is clear and tastes moderately sweet. 3  Dark corn syrup is a combination of corn syrup and molasses (or Refiners' syrup), caramel color and flavor, salt, and the preservative sodium benzoate.High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener made from corn and can be found in numerous foods and beverages on grocery store shelves in the United States. High fructose corn syrup is composed of either 42 percent or 55 percent fructose, with the remaining sugars being primarily glucose and higher sugars. In terms of composition, high fructose corn syrup is nearly identical to table sugar (sucrose), which is composed of 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose. Glucose is one of the simplest forms of sugar that serves as a building block for most carbohydrates. 1 High fructose corn syrup is made from corn, a natural grain product. 2  High fructose corn syrup contains no artificial or synthetic ingredients or color additives and meets the FDA requirements for use of the term “natural.”.
what does the water temperature need to be in a warewash	 High Temperature Dish Machines: 1.Final rinse water sprayed on the Ware must be delivered at a temperature of 180⁰ - 194⁰ F. 2.Final Rinse Water is heated to this temperature by a Booster Heater that is either an integral component of the Dish Machine, or is an external Device plumbed-in upstream of the Dish Machine. 3. Low Temperature, Chemical Sanitizing Dish Machines, require that the Wash Water be maintained at a minimum Temperature of 120⁰ F. 4.Typically, Low Temp Dish Machines do not have any type of integrated Heating Element’s in their Wash Tank. They receive their Hot Water from a domestic Hot Water Heater.But, if you ask a fish if the temperature of the water it is living in is important, it would yell yes! (if it could talk). In natural environments, temperature is not too much of a concern for aquatic life, since the animals and plants in the water have evolved to best survive in that environment. It is when the temperature of a water body changes, either by a natural event or by a human-induced event, that the fish start to worry. But, in winter some lake surfaces can get very cold. When this happens, the surface water becomes more dense than the deeper water with a more constant year-round temperature (which is now warmer than the surface), and the lake turns, when the colder surface water sinks to the lake bottom.
what is stool impaction	Fecal impaction is the formation of a large mass of hard stool in the rectum. While this stool may be too large to pass, loose, watery stool may be able to get by, leading to diarrhea or leakage of fecal material. Fecal impaction is a potential complication of chronic constipation. The development of constipation can be related to a diet low in fiber, limited fluid intake, medication side effects, lack of physical activity, or conditions affecting the colon, rectum or anus. Impacted stool may be removed in increments to reduce the risk of injuring the rectum. Suppositories may be used between each step of the manual extraction to help empty the rectum. Once fecal impaction has been treated, it is important to take steps to reduce the risk of future constipation.Fecal impaction is a mass of dry, hard stool that will not pass out of the colon or rectum. Fecal impaction is dry stool that cannot pass out of the body. Patients with fecal impaction may not have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Instead, they may have problems with circulation, the heart, or breathing. The following may be symptoms of fecal impaction: 1  Being unable to have a bowel movement. 2  Having to push harder to have a bowel movement of small amounts of hard, dry stool. 3  Having fewer than the usual number of bowel movements. 4  Having pain in the back or abdomen.
what is a meter cubed	In the opposite sense, 1 m 3 is equal to 0.000000001 kilometer cubed (10 -9 km 3). When converting between cubic meters and non-SI units of volume such as cubic inches (cu in) or cubic miles (cu mi), the linear-unit conversion factor must be cubed. For example, one meter is approximately 39.37 inches (39.37 in); therefore 1 m 3 = 39.37 3 = 6.102 x 10 4 cu in (approximately). The symbol for cubic meters is m 3. Less formally, cubic meter is sometimes abbreviated cu m. When calculating volume, it is important to realize that volume is proportional to the cube of the linear dimension.The cubic metre (in British English and international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures) or cubic meter (in American English) is the SI derived unit of volume. Its SI symbol is m3. It is the volume of a cube with edges one metre in length. An alternative name, which allowed a different usage with metric prefixes, was the stere, stère still sometimes used for dry (measure for, instance in reference to). Wood another alternative, name no longer widely, used was the. kilolitre Its SI symbol is m3. It is the volume of a cube with edges one metre in length.

what are the functional sites of a ribosome	Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) views of the ribosome bound to ternary complex and the ribosome with peptidyl-tRNA in the A site and deacylated tRNAs in the P and E sites are shown in Figure 3 (Valle et al., 2003). Figure 3. Binding of EF-Tu and tRNAs to the ribosome seen by cryo-EM. (A) Aminoacyl-tRNA in A/T site in ternary complex, peptidyl-tRNA in P site and deacylated tRNA in E site. (B) Pre-translocation ribosome with peptidyl-tRNA in A site, deacylated tRNAs in P and E site (From Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, one small and one large. Four binding sites are located on the ribosome, one for mRNA and three for tRNA. The three tRNA sites are labeled P, A, and E. The P site, called the peptidyl site, binds to the tRNA holding the growing polypeptide chain of amino acids. The A site (acceptor site), binds to the aminoacyl tRNA, which holds the new amino acid to be added to the polypeptide chain. The E site (exit site), serves as a threshold, the final transitory step before a tRNA now bereft of its amino acid is let go by the ribosome. Figure %: Amino Acid. When amino acids are transferred from the aminoacyl tRNA in the A site to the growing protein chain attached to the P site, they are transferred in a specific orientation so that the chain grows by adding amino acids to the carboxyl, not nitrogen, end of the chain.
how long does it take for spider veins to disappear after sclerotherapy	It is quite variable from patient to patient and from vein to vein. Most of the times takes at least 3-4 weeks before some results can be appreciated, however could go as long as 3 months.before improvement can be noticeable. 5 years ago by Vanish Vein and Laser Center Sclerotherapy is a process. Some veins may resolve immediately but most take 3 to 6 weeks. Often times multiple treatments are required with an interval between treatments of 4 to 6 weeks. 5 years ago by Miller Vein Usually the veins that are going to fade will do so in a few weeks. Those that haven't faded will need to be retreated (delay by at least 4 weeks). The typical patient requires 3 - 6 treatment session to obtain good results.2 years ago by Vein Treatment and Aesthetic Center It usually requires a few sclerotherapy treatments (spaced 3 weeks apart) for the veins to completely disappear. In my experience, it typically takes an average of 3 treatments for each spider vein. 4 years ago by Laser Vein Center The short answer is most disappear in 6 to 8 weeks but some may take as long as 8 months. After sclerotherapy spider veins may take 4 to 6 weeks to resolve. However, sclerotherapy often requires multiple treatments and I usually tell patients that some veins will disappear within several days, some within several weeks and some will need several treatments.
how to stop flies coming through the window	Install new screens to prevent flies from entering a home. Fix any holes in the window or windowsill that allow flies inside. Check for cracks, holes, crevices and anything that can act as an entrance point. Fill any entrance points you find with caulk to seal the hole. To do this, simply buy a caulk gun and a tube of caulk from any hardware store or big box store. Keeping a room free of uneaten food and other trash will keep flies from being attracted to an area. Also keep garbage cans and dumpsters as far away from windows and homes as possible. Place a sticky trap near a window to capture any stray flies that do get into a home. Hang the sticky trap in a window sill or near the window. Flies will get stuck on the trap, and the dead flies and trap can be replaced as neededYou can help to prevent various fly infestations from occurring in your home or business through sanitation methods and effective pest control. When you think of a fly, the typical house fly comes to mind, but what you may not know is that there are several varieties of flies that can inhabit your home or business.

how much should i pay to have a tree cut down	Step 2. Calculate the cost based on the size of your tree. Although prices vary depending on the company and the area in which you live, you can assume that you'll pay $10 per foot to have a large tree cut down. The smaller the tree, the less money per foot it will cost. A tree up to 30 feet tall will typically cost about $8 per foot, and a medium tree up to 60 feet tall will usually cost about $9 per foot to have it removed. Although it can vary depending on the company, typically a large tree is 60 to 80 feet tall. A small tree is usually 30 feet tall or shorter, and a medium tree is commonly 30 to 60 feet in height. Anything over 80 feet tall is considered to be very large and, therefore, much more costly to remove.1 To get rid of the tree stump itself, you will want to plan on paying around $100 to $500 depending on the size. 2  They will usually grind it to the ground. 3  If there are obstacles in the way, it can increase your quote by as much as 50%. 4  If you are near a utility pole, you may want to have them consult with you first. Tree removal cost: 1  On average, professional tree removing is going to cost anywhere from $250 to as much as $15,000 a tree. 2  A typical job at house is going to cost anywhere from $600 to $3,500. 3  A smaller tree that is no bigger than 25 feet is going to generally range around $100 – $400.

can i use morsels or baking chips for dipping	So many choices. You see morsels, baking squares and whole chocolate bars and this can be difficult to know which to buy as a substitution. If you are choosing chocolate morsels, also called chocolate chips, instead of semi-sweet baking squares, this is an easy substitution to make, if you keep in mind a few caveats. Since morsels have less cocoa butter than baking squares -- which makes the morsels more stable when heated -- you can use morsels in recipes that call for melted chocolate, but not as part of a batter. You can also use morsels in ganache, chocolate frosting, or in a simple chocolate dip for fondue. Pour the morsels into a microwave-safe bowl and heat on high for 45 seconds. Remove and stir. Continue to microwave for 10-second intervals until the morsels are smooth when stirredHow to melt chocolate chips (and other baking chips) in a slow cooker and maintain a perfect melted consistency.

what are the names of the brain parts	The brain is composed of three parts: the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebrum. The cerebrum is divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. 1  The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is composed of right and left hemispheres. It performs higher functions like interpreting touch, vision and hearing, as well as speech, reasoning, emotions, learning, and fine control of movement. The cerebellum is located under the cerebrum. Nerve cells make up the gray surface of the cerebrum which is a little thicker than your thumb. White nerve fibers underneath carry signals between the nerve cells and other parts of the brain and body. The neocortex occupies the bulk of the cerebrum. The brain is made of three main parts: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain consists of the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus (part of the limbic system). The midbrain consists of the tectum and tegmentum. The hindbrain is made of the cerebellum, pons and medulla. Often the midbrain, pons, and medulla are referred to together as the brainstem. The Cerebrum: The cerebrum or cortex is the largest part of the human brain, associated with higher brain function such as thought and action. The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe
typical boat sales commission	Some salespeople may be paid a commission that is variable and based on sales volume. This means that the more you sell, the higher your commission rate for the month. Such a commission structure usually has the rate increasing by 0.5 percent for each tier of sales. Sales tiers vary greatly by industry. For example, a retail store may have tiers of up to $2,500, $2,501 to $4,000, $4,001 to $6,500, and $6,501 and up. Insurance agents are paid a base salary in addition to the commission. For car salespeople, the average commission rate is 30 percent on the front end after dealer costs. The front end is the difference between the selling price and the price the dealer paid for the vehicle. Related Reading: Sales Commission DutiesThe commission paid on big-ticket products may be less as a percentage of gross revenue than a small ticket product. However, the salesperson may earn more money for the big-ticket product. Suppose the commission is 5 percent for selling a $150,000 boat and 10 percent for selling electronic gizmos that retail for $500. For example, the commission is 4 percent for sales up to $30,000 in a month, 5 percent for sales from $30,001 to $50,000 per month and 7 percent for sales $50,001 or more. Another alternative is for the percentage to be retroactive and apply to all sales once the higher sales level is reached.

what are the 6 parts of the brain	The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain, and contains tools which are responsible for most of the brain's function. It is divided into four sections: the temporal lobe, the occipital lobe, parietal lobe and frontal lobe.he brain is made up of nerve cells which interact with the rest of the body through the spinal cord and nervous system. These cells relate information back to specific centers of the brain where it can be processed and an appropriate reaction can be generated.The brain is made of three main parts: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain consists of the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus (part of the limbic system). The midbrain consists of the tectum and tegmentum.The hindbrain is made of the cerebellum, pons and medulla.Often the midbrain, pons, and medulla are referred to together as the brainstem. The Cerebrum: The cerebrum or cortex is the largest part of the human brain, associated with higher brain function such as thought and action.The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe.he brain is made of three main parts: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.

what is overhead rate in managerial accounting?	Classify the following costs of this new product as direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, selling, or administrative. President’s salary. Packages used to hold the skin wipes. Cleaning materials used to clean the skin wipe packages. Wages of workers who package the product.Predetermined overhead rate is estimated overhead divided by estimated activity. The example states that estimated activity is 200,000 direct labor hours. $1,250,000 / 200,000 direct labor hours = $6.25 per direct labor hour (don’t forget to label your numbers) Applying the predetermined overhead rate to jobs. Alright, so we have a rate. Now what? We must apply the rate to our jobs. The rate from our example above is $6.25 per direct labor hour. How do we apply this to our jobs? Based on the direct labor hours worked on the job. For each direct labor hour worked, we will add $6.25 of overhead to the job. Applied overhead is overhead added to a job by taking the predetermined overhead rate multiplied by the actual activity. Applied overhead is added to direct materials and direct labor to calculate total job cost. Total Job Cost = Direct Materials + Direct Labor + Applied Overhead. Every time a job is completed, overhead is applied to the job. The total cost of all the jobs completed over the course of the year is cost of goods sold. Example #2
are limpets nocturnal	Defenses & predators. Defenses of limpets include attachment strength, shell, escape crawling, and camouflage (both visual and chemical). Chief predators are crabs, fishes, and sea stars when the tide is in, and birds when the tide is out. There is overlap between defenses and predators. Keyhole limpets Diodora aspera are often richly adorned with growths of colonial tunicates, sponges, and bryozoans. Whether this is for visual or chemical camouflage is not known. The individual in the photo on the Right seems visually camouflaged (to our eyes), but not the one on the Left.The class Gastropoda includes snails and slugs of all kinds and all sizes from microscopic to large. There are many thousands of species of sea snails and sea slugs, as well as freshwater snails, freshwater limpets, land snails and land slugs. The class Gastropoda contains a vast total of named species, second only to the insects in overall number. The fossil history of this class goes back to the Late Cambrian. There are 611 families of gastropods known, of which 202 are extinct and appear only in the fossil record. However, eyes in gastropods range from simple ocelli that only distinguish light and dark, to more complex pit eyes, and even to lens eyes. In land snails and slugs, vision is not the most important sense, because they are mainly nocturnal animals.
what is allocation accounting book	Cost allocation is the process of identifying, aggregating, and assigning costs to cost objects. A cost object is any activity or item for which you want to separately measure costs. Examples of cost objects are a product, a research project, a customer, a sales region, and a department. Cost allocation is used for financial reporting purposes, to spread costs among departments or inventory items. Cost allocation is also used in the calculation of profitability at the department or subsidiary level, which in turn may be used as the basis for bonuses or the funding of additional activities. Cost allocations can also be used in the derivation of transfer prices between subsidiaries. Example of Cost Allocation.Cost allocation and cost apportionment are methods for attributing cost to particular cost objects (Cost object is a term referring simply to any item associated with a cost figure of its own). The assignment of cost figures to specific cost objects is a central task in budgeting, planning, and financial reporting. ) The advantage to ABC is that it comes closer to accurate, direct measurement of some cost objects than does traditional cost allocation/apportionment. The disadvantage to ABC is that it is accounting intensive, that is, it requires substantially more hours of analysis and accounting time than traditional methods.
what is a domain name?	A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names can also be thought of as a location where certain information or activities can be found. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. A fictitious domain name is a domain name used in a work of fiction or popular culture to refer to a domain that does not actually exist, often with invalid or unofficial top-level domains such as  .web , a usage exactly analogous to the dummy 555 telephone number prefix used in film and other media.An Internet Protocol, or IP, address is different than a domain name. The IP address is an actual set of numerical instructions. It communicates exact information about the address in a way that is useful to the computer but makes no sense to humans. The domain name functions as a link to the IP address. Domain Names and URLs. The universal resource locator, or URL, is an entire set of directions, and it contains extremely detailed information. The domain name is one of the pieces inside of a URL. It is also the most easily recognized part of the entire address.
what is cruiserweight	In professional wrestling, a cruiserweight is a wrestler weighing below 220 lb (100 kg), with no lower weight limit.The older term junior heavyweight, which was used to describe the division, is more favored in Japan, where many titles for lighter-weight competitors are called junior heavyweight titles. In 2002, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling created the X Division Championship, a title with no upper or lower weight limits but which epitomized the stereotypical cruiserweight style. The division is considered a defining moment in cruiserweight wrestling and is also considered to be TNA Wrestling's top draw.Cruiserweight (also referred to as junior heavyweight) is a weight class in boxing between light heavyweight and heavyweight. Before the advent of the current cruiserweight class, light heavyweight and cruiserweight were sometimes used interchangeably in the United Kingdom. The current weight limit for the division is 200 pounds (14 stone 4 pounds / 90.7 kg). When originally established, the weight limit was 190 pounds (86.2 kg). Camel won and became the first IBF cruiserweight champion. Several boxers moved up to Heavyweight after winning world titles at Crusierweight. Evander Holyfield unified the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles to become undisputed champion, the first to do so, and then moved up to the heavyweight division in 1988.
the chemical category that includes fats and cholesterol is	Thank you for a very good question and one that's confusing to many people. In the world of food science, there is one very large umbrella category that includes both cholesterol and fat. That category is called lipids.. Unfortunately, this word isn't used much in everyday conversation. Not only does it have chemical rings in its structure, but these ring structures have to occur in a very particular configuration. It's fairly complicated for our bodies to make this unique type of fat. In a practical, dietary sense, there is one very basic difference between cholesterol and other fats. Most of the time when we talk about fat in food, we are talking about fairly large amounts of food parts that contain large amounts of calories. It's not uncommon for a fast food meal to contain over 50 grams of fatBest Answer: In the world of food science, there is one very large umbrella category that includes both cholesterol and fat.

what is the pyloric caeca	The Pyloric Caeca is a finger-like out-pocketing of the intestine where it meets the end of the stomach (pylorus). Also spelled cecum (ceca). Serves to aid digestion. It is … basically where digestion occurs, as it aids the stomach in digestion. The pyloric sphincter divides the stomach from the duodenum of the small intestine. As a sphincter muscle, it has the ability to contract and relax. This controls the amount a … nd rate of stomach contents being emptied into the small intestines, and prevents back flow into the stomach. 3 people found this useful.The cecum or caecum (/ˈsiːkəm/ , plural ceca /ˈsiːkə/ ; from the Latin caecus meaning blind) is an intraperitoneal pouch, that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine. It receives chyme from the ileum, and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine. It is separated from the ileum by the ileocecal valve (ICV) or Bauhin's valve. It is also separated from the colon by the cecocolic junction. The appendix is connected to the cecum. While the cecum is usually intraperitoneal, the ascending colon is retroperitoneal. In herbivores, the cecum stores food material where bacteria are able to break down the cellulose. This function no longer occurs in the human cecum (see appendix), so in humans it is simply a dead-end pouch forming a part of the large intestin
importance of action research for teachers	Please cite as: Hine, G. S. C. (2013). The importance of action research in teacher education programs. In Design, develop, evaluate: The core of the learning environment. Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Teaching Learning Forum, 7-8 February 2013. Perth: Murdoch University. Third, teacher educators engaged in a new model of teacher inservice training. After examining the outcomes of the program, Perrett concluded that the results suggest that there is real scope for continuing to develop ways of marrying the input and action research models of inservice teacher development (p. 9).Action research is actually suitable for any person who wishes to improve his or her performance; or any group or organization who hopes for doing the same. As a matter of fact, action research is widely used in education, especially by teachers who use it to improve their teaching. Teachers from all over the world, from the United States, Australia, New Zealand to Vietnam, etc have employed action research as a part of their teaching and research. ● In most cases, solutions for identified problems are arrived cooperatively among teachers. ● Teachers are often more committed to action research because they identify the areas they view as problematical and in need of change. ● Action research is an ongoing process and its strategies can be widely applied.
average paid leave time nonprofits	Employees with 20 years of service have 21.7 vacation days, according to the data on more than 100 industry-specific job titles and more than 250 benchmark titles ranging from entry-level to top executives. Exempt and nonexempt employees are granted an average of three personal days and 11 sick days per year. Not-for-profit organizations generally allow employees to carry vacation days from one year to the next, but 85 percent of the respondents limit the number of days that can be carried over. “In retaining top employees, many organizations are finding enhancements to time-off programs may be a viable alternative to granting pay increases,” said Amy Kaminski, director of marketing for Compdata Surveys, which this month released the 2010 Compensation Data Not-for-Profit study.After one year of employment, employees received an average of 21 days off; after five years, they averaged 25 days off; and after 10 years of service, employees received an average of 28 paid days off. Only 3 percent of the Connecticut nonprofits included sick days in their PTO plan. Employees formerly used personal days mainly to take care of matters such as illnesses or family issues. But as modern schedules have changed, some nonprofit human resources' policies now include paid time off for daycare pick-up and drop-off, half-days and work-at-home days.
what is soba	Soba-These noodles are made from buckwheat flour and have a correspondingly strong, nutty flavor. Many buckwheat noodles also have some wheat flour in them, which means they're not gluten-free. However, pure buckwheat soba can be found — it's stronger in flavor and really delicious, and of course, gluten-free. Once upon a time, if you wanted to make a recipe that called for soba, udon, or any other kind of Asian noodle, you had to also find your nearest Asian grocery store. Happily, these noodles have become much easier to find in recent years. Here's a quick guide to the most common kinds!Soba /ˈsoʊbə/ (そば or 蕎麦) is the Japanese name for buckwheat. It is synonymous with a type of thin noodle made from buckwheat flour, and in Japan can refer to any thin noodle (unlike thick wheat noodles, known as udon). Soba noodles are served either chilled with a dipping sauce, or in hot broth as a noodle soup. It takes three months for buckwheat to be ready for harvest, so it can be harvested four times a year, mainly in spring, summer, and autumn. Soba is the traditional noodle of choice for Tokyoites. This tradition originates from the Tokugawa period, when the population of Edo (Tokyo), being considerably wealthier than the rural poor, were more susceptible to beriberi due to their high consumption of white rice, which is low in thiamine.
what was the name of the ship james cook captained to australia	1 Navigator and astronomer Captain James Cook claimed the whole of the east coast of Australia for Great Britain on 22 August 1770, naming eastern Australia 'New South Wales'. 2  School A to Z features links to third-party websites and resources. 3  We are not responsible for the content of external sites. In 1770, Captain Cook 'discovered' the south east coast of Australia, landing in Botany Bay. On 22 August 1770, he claimed the whole of the east coast of Australia at Possession Island, naming eastern Australia New South Wales.Cook's best known ship was the ' Endeavour ', which departed Plymouth, England, on 26 August 1768 on Cook's expedition to observe the transit of Venus from the vantage point of Tahiti. It was on this journey that Cook circumnavigated New Zealand and the eastern coast of Australia. On Cook's second and third journeys, he commanded the ' Resolution ' and the ' Adventure '. On his third journey, Cook also had a consort ship, the Discovery, which was commanded by Charles Clerke, not by Cook himself. Captain James Cook's major exploration was arguably his first expedition. On Cook's first journey, departing in 1768, his mission was to chart the transit of Venus. Commanding … the 'Endeavour', Cook went on to search for Terra Australis Incognita, the great continent which some believed to extend round the pole.
where are opiate receptors located within the brain	Opioid receptors are a group of inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands. The endogenous opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins and nociceptin. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). The receptors were first identified as specific molecules through the use of binding studies, in which opiates that had been labeled with radioisotopes were found to bind to brain membrane homogenates. The first such study was published in 1971, using 3H-levorphanol.Opiates elicit their powerful effects by activating opiate receptors that are widely distributed throughout the brain and body. Once an opiate reaches the brain, it quickly activates the opiate receptors that are found in many brain regions and produces an effect that correlates with the area of the brain involved. Two important effects produced by opiates, such as morphine, are pleasure (or reward) and pain relief. The brain itself also produces substances known as endorphins that activate the opiate receptors. When a person injects, sniffs, or orally ingests heroin (or morphine), the drug travels quickly to the brain through the bloodstream. Once in the brain, the heroin is rapidly converted to morphine, which then activates opiate receptors located throughout the brain, including within the reward system.

why is it called CMYK	CMYK refers to the primary colors of pigment: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. These are the inks used on the press in 4-color process printing, commonly referred to as full color printing or four color printing. The combination of RGB light creates white, while the combination of CMYK inks creates black. About RGB-CMYK. 1  Scanners, digital cameras and computer monitors use red, green and blue (RGB) light to display color. 2  Commercial printing presses print with cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK) ink, called process printing, instead of RGB light, and therefore produce a different range of color.CMYK is a subtractive color model that is used in color printing, and it refers to cyan, magenta, yellow, and black for the inks used in color printing. The “K” in CMYK is understood to be the key since in four-color printing cyan, magenta, and yellow printing plates are aligned with the black plate which is the key. In other words the other colors are setup in relation to the black which is thus the key to the process. The fact that it is subtractive means that in the CMYK process the color results are achieved by masking colors on a lighter background. Often this background is white and the color may be masked either partially or completely, depending on the color desired. CMYK is often used for printing in four color process.
how long does it take for frost to melt	Water, like all types of matter, freezes at a specific temperature. The freezing point for water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). When the temperature of water falls to 0 degrees Celsius and below, it begins to change to ice. As it freezes, it releases heat to its surroundings. However, in some ways water is not like other types of matter. The ground freezes when the water in the ground becomes ice, as it did during the Ice Bowl. The ground thaws when the pore ice melts. Note that when talking about frozen ground thawing, scientists do not use the word melt.. That term refers to a solid becoming a liquid.An ice cube melts in the 109 degree temperatures. It takes about 12 to 13 minutes to melt an oversized ice cube on concrete in 109 degrees. But it only takes about 6 minutes to fry an iPhone. We were going to give you the exact time it took to melt an ice cube (with video proof), but after a quarter of an hour in the sweltering heat, all we came back with was a bag full of water, a malfunctioning iPhone and a sunburn. Not long after we learned the temperature had finally peaked at 109 degrees, breaking the all-time high record for Amarillo, someone got the bright idea to see how long it would take to melt an ice cube on the sidewalk. The brilliant thought that didn’t cross our minds? Hey, 109 degrees is really hot.
what is iron used for in phytoplankton	Iron fertilization is the intentional introduction of iron to the upper ocean to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. This is intended to enhance biological productivity, which can benefit the marine food chain and is under investigation in hopes of increasing carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Iron is a trace element necessary for photosynthesis in all plants. It is highly insoluble in sea water and is often the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth. Large algal blooms can be created by supplying iron to iron-deficient ocean waters. Current estimates of the amount of iron required to restore all the lost plankton and sequester 3 gigatons /year of CO 2 range widely, from approximately 2 hundred thousand tons/year to over 4 million tons/year.Phytoplankton /ˌfaɪtoʊˈplaeŋktən/ ˌfaɪtoʊˈplæŋktən are the autotrophic components of the plankton community and a key factor of, oceans seas and freshwater basin. Ecosystems the name comes from The greek words (φυτόν), phyton  meaning , plant and (πλαγκτός), planktos meaning wanderer or. drifter Large-scale experiments have added iron (usually as salts such as iron sulphate) to the oceans to promote phytoplankton growth and draw atmospheric CO2 into the ocean. However, controversy about manipulating the ecosystem and the efficiency of iron fertilization has slowed such experiments.
what is ldh in blood test	In order to know what is LDH blood test, one would need knowledge about what does LDH mean. LDH is known by various names, LD, lactatic dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, LDH isoenzymes, or total LDH. LDH (consisting of five molecular forms of LDH) is an enzyme found in all cells and tissues of the body. This enzyme is released into the blood once there is trauma or damage to a tissue or organ. After a tissue damage, LDH level increases in the blood. If the LDH level is uncommonly high, then the doctor will call for LDH blood test to identify organs that have been affected. Levels of all five isoenzymes or components of LDH are taken into account when diagnosing LDH blood test results.Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme that helps facilitate the process of turning sugar into energy for your cells to use. LDH is present in many kinds of organs and tissues throughout the body, including the liver, heart, pancreas, kidneys, skeletal muscles, brain, and blood cells. When illness or injury damages your cells, LDH may be released into the bloodstream, causing the level of LDH in your blood to rise. Taking an LDH Test. LDH levels are normally measured using a blood draw. Occasionally, LDH levels may be measured using urine or cerebrospinal fluid. In adults, blood is taken from a vein at the inner elbow or the back of the hand.

You just need to add 1 egg and 1/3 cup of milk (buttermilk, Greek yogurt or sour cream) to the mixture. If you are wondering how to make the cornbread extra moist, I’ll share few tips with you. Add 4 more tablespoons of oil or melted butter to the mix and let the better stand for about 20 minutes so that cornmeal absorbs moisture.
viruses bacteria and fungi that cause human disease	Failure to respond effectively can result in disease or death. Disease is a disturbance of homeostasis or steady state within an organism. Many organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites may cause disease. Disease also results from factors which are not living organisms. The immune response is the defensive reaction of the body to foreign substances or organisms. The immune system also protects against some cancer cells which may arise in the body. Some Causes of Disease Living organisms which cause disease are known as pathogens. Some viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are examples of living things which are pathogens causing disease. Other factors may be involved which contribute to or cause the body to develop diseaseA human pathogen is a pathogen (microbe or microorganism such as a virus, bacterium, prion, or fungus) that causes disease in humans. The human physiological defense against common pathogens (such as Pneumocystis) is mainly the responsibility of the immune system with help by some of the body's normal flora and fauna. However, if the immune system or good microbiota are damaged in any way (such as by chemotherapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or antibiotics being taken to kill other pathogens), pathogenic bacteria that were being held at bay can proliferate and cause harm to the host.
how many carbs should you eat if you are trying to lose weight	Sedentary women between the ages of 19 and 30 should consume between 1,800 and 2,000 calories per day. Carbohydrates should account for 810 to 1,300 of your calories each day. As there are 4 calories in 1 gram of carbohydrates, this amounts to 202.5 to 325 grams of carbohydrates per day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, you should consume 1,800 calories per day and 202.5 to 292.5 grams of carbohydrates. Moderately Active. Moderately active women between the ages of 19 and 30 should try to eat 2,000 to 2,200 calories per day. As carbohydrates should account for 900 to 1,430 of these calories, you should eat 225 to 357.5 grams of carbs each day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, these values decrease to 2,000 calories and between 225 and 325 grams of carbs every dayGenerally speaking, you should be able to eat 50-100 grams per day of carbohydrates and lose weight. Maybe 100 on workout days and 50 on non workout days. Keep your carbs around your workout and have protein/fat meals the rest of the day. Hey. Now, i read A LOT about low carb diet. Thanks! With 100 grams of carbohydrates, you should be able to eat a lean meat, a healthy fat, a fruit, and a veggie in every single one of your 5 meals (if you choose to eat that many) without going over your allotment. Fruits and vegetables are healthy – no doubt about it.
what cavity is backbone in	The vertebral column is more commonly known as the spine, spinal column, or backbone, and it consists of several oddly shaped bones, called vertebrae. It performs a number of essential functions in the human body. These functions include structure and support, movement, and protection of vital nerves and organs. The atlas and the axis are the top two vertebrae of the backbone that combine to make a pivot joint. This joint allows the head to move from side to side, and also up and down. The rest of the spine, along with a number of different muscles and ligaments, also aids a person in certain types of other movements.Vertebral column of a goat. The vertebral column, also known as the backbone or spine, is a bony skeletal structure found in vertebrates. It is formed from individual bones called vertebrae (singular: vertebra), which houses the spinal canal, a cavity that encloses and protects the spinal cord. There about 50,000 species of animals that have a vertebral column. The human vertebral column is one of the most-studied examples. It is commonly called the spine, or simply backbone. The articulating vertebrae are grouped into their regions; there are seven cervical vertebrae of the neck (C1 to C7); twelve thoracic vertebrae of the thorax (T1 to T12); and five lumbar vertebrae of the lower back above the pelvis (L1 to L5).
what causes columnar jointing	Columnar Jointing. Columnar jointing forms in lava flows, sills, dikes, ignimbrites (ashflow tuffs), and shallow intrusions of all compositions. Most columns are straight with parallel sides and diameters from a few centimeters to 3 m. Some columns are curved and vary in width. Columns can reach heights of 30 m. This photo is an early 20th century postcard of the Honeycomb at Giants Causeway. Entablature is probably the result of cooling caused by fresh lava being covered by water. The flood basalts probably damned rivers. When the rivers returned the water seeped down the cracks in the cooling lava and caused rapid cooling from the surface downward (Long and Wood, 1986).Columnar jointing in Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Columnar jointing is a geological structure where sets of intersecting closely spaced fractures, referred to as joints, result in the formation of a regular array of polygonal prisms, or columns. Columnar jointing occurs in many types of volcanic rocks and forms as the rock cools and contracts. Columnar jointing can occur in cooling lava flows and ashflow tuffs (ignimbrites), as well as in some shallow intrusions. The columns can vary from 3 meters to a few centimeters in diameter, and can be as much as 30 meters tall. They are typically parallel and straight, but can also be curved and vary in diameter
average salary of an nhl scout	At this stage, Jones is more concerned with consistent and accurate evaluations than making a high salary. “You won’t get ‘rich’ [working as a scout] until you make in to the NHL,” said Jones. “NHL scouts tend make between $50,000 and $100,000 US a year depending on the team and how long they have been scouting for. “Right now, I have all my expenses paid for when I’m on the road, and I get a weekly salary, which I make work.”. But with an average height and a fairly lean frame, he didn’t boast a build that enabled him to seriously pursue the game as an athlete. He saw scouting as his best route. However, getting there was not easy. As he put it, the hardest part of being a hockey scout is getting the job to begin with.Standard officials’ fees back then were $220 for a regular season game and $500 for a playoff game. AHL referees at the time made $100 for a regular season game and $125 for playoff matches. The average NHL player salary in 1970 was $18,000, so Udvari was doing well, even compared to the players he was overseeing. From the Hartford Courant in 1997: “[Linesmen] top out at $125,000 on the union scale after 24 years, roughly 60 percent of what senior referees make.” That works out to a senior referee salary of $208,000, or $310,000 in 2014 dollars. NHL players don’t get paid in the playoffs – at least, not formally.
difference between income and salary	Salary vs Income. Any individual requires some form of inflow of funds in order to purchase the goods and services that can satisfy their needs. Salary and income share common properties in that they are both forms of monetary inflows of funds that are received by an individual. The two are different from each other because of the source from which these funds are received, even though the use of the funds may be for common purposes. • Salary is an inflow received in exchange for a service provided to a firm, whereas an individual does not necessarily have to provide services to receive an income. • Salary is also a form of income, and both salaries and incomes are taxable depending on the tax bracket the individual belongs.Income that an individual receives can be in the form of investment income, salaries, payment receipts, profits, dividends, or any other form of funds inflow. Income that is received by an individual is usually taxable, and tax rates that are applied will depend on the level of income obtained from the income source. • Salary is an inflow received in exchange for a service provided to a firm, whereas an individual does not necessarily have to provide services to receive an income. • Salary is also a form of income, and both salaries and incomes are taxable depending on the tax bracket the individual belongs.
how to tell if someone is missing you	But, when you want to continue relationship with the person you keep on missing, you need to be clear with your intention. According to me there might be following reasons: 1  You also miss someone special when you are in love with that person. 2  It might be infatuation (just for a few days). 3  You respect her/his qualities. Please don’t ever miss bad times you spend with that person. Always try to cherish the good moments and it will surely bring a smile on your face. Another thing which people do is to hide their feelings in front of person they are missing. You must keep your ego aside and convey your feelings to that person. Life is too short; if you love or you miss someone do let them know. If that person understands you, it would never ruin your relationshipSurprise him by leaving behind a note! Another way of how to make someone miss you is by writing a small note, and putting it secretly inside your guy’s wallet, car or room before you leave.

india basic salary calculation	Salary does not apply in India due to the below components. 1. Basic Salary (Base Salary) – This is most important component of the salary because it is used as basis for calculation of retirement benefit and calculation of tax exemption for certain allowances. Generally, basic salary is fixed between 30% to 50% of total salary. It is done so that employee can get an appropriate tax exemption as well as retirement benefit. 2. House Rent Allowance (HRA) – HRA is basically an allowance, which forms a part of one’s taxable salary. It is in the range of the 40% or 50% of basic salary. It is not mandatory for the employer to give HRA. But, if an employer chooses to offer the allowance as part of salary then employee may get some part of it as tax-free if the employee satisfies certain conditions. 3Dear seniors what is the formula for calculation of el s? basic / 26 x no.of el s if the ...

what is fib slicing	A fid is a conical tool traditionally made of wood or bone. It is used to work with rope and canvas in marlinespike seamanship. A fid differs from a marlinspike in material and purpose. A marlinespike is used in working with wire rope, may be used to open shackles, and is made of metal. A fid is used to hold open knots and holes in canvas, and to separate the lays (or strands) of synthetic or natural rope for splicing. A variation of the fid, the gripfid, is used for ply-split braiding. It adds a jamming cleat to pull a cord back through the cord split by the fid's point. A fid is also a small, pointed tool, with a bulbous hand-grip, used in the tape-and-solder method of building stained glass. In this method, copper foil tape is adhered to the edges of the cut glass. The fid is then used to press the tape, thereby assuring adherence.Image quality and consistency are critical in order to connect features from slice to slice. Figure 2 shows consecutive SEM images of shale in a FIB/SEM run with slice thicknesses, or the distance between the images, of 100 and 10 nanometers. Consecutive slices show the variations as more material is removed. The top slice is the surface, and the images beneath it are taken with steps of 100 (left) and 10 (right) nanometers. Backscatter electron images were acquired with 3.0 nanometers resolution.
how to become interpreter for deaf	Once you're comfortable with your knowledge of ASL and deaf culture, you may apply to test for certification. Several levels of certification are available through the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and the National Association of the Deaf (NAD).

cost of quarterly worming a horse	This usually costs around $25 or $30. Add in shoeing, and you could pay $80 to $100 every two months. Routine medical care is an additional cost of owning a horse and includes vaccinations, de-worming and annual teeth cleaning. For a healthy horse, this can cost as little as $300 a year. But the purchase price is just one part of the cost of a horse. In fact, the cost of owning a horse can range dramatically depending on the breed, age and disposition of your horse, where you live, where you plan to keep the horse and what type of work you plan to do with the horse.Corrective shoeing, of course, will be much higher. Horses are continuely plagued by intestinal parasites and need worming every 2 months. The cost is $13 each worming, each horse. Semi-annual vaccinations for tetanus, influenza, rhinopneumonitis, etc. are approximately $35 per horse twice per year. Currently a single bale of hay is $15 to $20 depending on the season and type of hay. A horse eats about one and a half bales per week or 2% of their optimum body weight per day. The monthly cost of hay per horse is approximately $100 to $120. Supplements such as grain, bran and psyllium can be as much as $25 per month per horse. Some horses require special supplements such as glucosomine for arithritic conditions and this can add $40 extra per horse needing it per month

what wavelength does chlorophyll absorb	A pigment is a compound that absorbs a particular wavelength of visible light. Chlorophyll is a green pigment contained in thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts that is used in photosynthesis by plants. In bacteria that also perform photosynthesis, chlorophylls are in the plasma membrane. The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of wavelengths from the radio waves of your car stereo to high-energy gamma rays. Chlorophyll and other pigments absorb specific visible wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The visible light is literally the colored wavelengths that are visible to your eyes. They range from red at a wavelength of 700 nm to blue at a wavelength of 400 nmChlorophyll absorbs certain wavelengths of light within the visible light spectrum. As shown in detail in the absorption spectra, chlorophyll absorbs light in the red (long wavelength) and the blue (short wavelength) regions of the visible light spectrum. Green light is not absorbed but reflected, making the plant appear green. Chlorophyll is found in the chloroplasts of plants. Plants are able to satisfy their energy requirements by absorbing light from the blue and red parts of the spectrum. However, there is still a large spectral region between 500 and 600 nm where chlorophyll absorbs very little light, and plants appear green because this light is reflected.
what is the name of a gray wolf	The gray wolf or grey wolf (Canis lupus) also known as the timber wolf, or western wolf, is a canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of North America and Eurasia. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg (95–99 lb), and females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb). Globally, gray wolf taxonomy has been subject to numerous revisions, particularly in North America. As of 2005, 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3. Its list includes the domestic dog, dingo, eastern wolf and red wolf, but lists C. l. italicus and C. l. communis as synonyms of C. l. lupus.Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. As of 2005, 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3. The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), also known as the common wolf.

how long do black bear cubs stay with it mother	The den is warmer than the outside due to the heat generated by the bears. The snow traps air molecules and acts as insulation. Polar bear cubs spend the majority of their early childhood days in the safety of the den to stay warm and to bond with their mother. The cubs typically nurse for 12 to 18 weeks. However longer periods have been recorded depending on the number of siblings, season length, and factors in the environment that effect food sources. The mother's milk is very nutritious and the cubs grow rapidly in size and weight. A newborn baby is ready to eat solid food in just a few months. They grow their own new fur within approximately 8 to 10 weeks, although it can take up to 14 weeks. The cute pups begin to resemble their mother and will soon copy her habits. After about 3 or 4 months polar bear cubs venture outside the den with their mother. Combined with their instincts, they learn survival and hunting skills from their mother. The pups stay close to mom wherever she goes.30. Mother and 7-month-old cubs. Black bear mothers stay with their cubs until the cubs are 16 or 17 months old. Then, in late May or June, just before the mothers begin attracting males to mate for their next litter, the mothers separate from their yearlings but allow them to remain in the maternal territory.

what type of cat is buttercup from the hunger games	Author Suzanne Collins and director Francis Lawrence, however, do not share my nonchalance about pet appearance, and Prim’s cat has been recast for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. That’s right: Buttercup will actually be orange, and not black-and-white like in the first film. Francis Lawrence told io9: “You know what [getting a new cat] was actually, and I was happy to do it, that was a request from Nina [Jacobson] the producer and Suzanne the author. That they thought the cat from the first movie was not the way he was described in the book. And that had annoyed a bunch of fans, and things like that. But it also just kind of bothered them that Buttercup was not a black and white cat. So I was happy to get one that felt like the Buttercup of the book. It’s funny because now people are ...buttercup, catching fire, hunger games. Prim’s cat Buttercup has gone from being black and white in The Hunger Games movie to ginger in Catching Fire, meaning he is now loyal to the source material. A new photo from The Hunger Games: Catching Fire depicts Buttercup on the lap of Katniss’ sister Prim (played by Willow Shields), and she’s very clearly gone back to being ginger like described in the trilogy by Suzanne Collins. It’s not clear why filmmakers made the switch or what made them decide to use a black and white cat in the first place.
is catecholamine a steroid	Under this method of classification, there are four groupings: steroids, peptides, amino acid and fatty acid. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol. The sex hormones (androgens, estrogens and progesterone) and hormones produced in the adrenal glands.Adrenal gland hormones include the mineralcoritcosteriods and gluccorticosteriods. Steroid hormones have a few important functions in the body including water balance, sexual development and stress response.Steroid Hormone Production from Cholesterol. The next type is the amino acid derivative hormones.ther examples include LH (lutenizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). LH acts on the gonads to produce eggs and sperm while FSH stimulates the gonads to produce steroids. Non-tropic hormones behave in an opposite manner.There are two types of tyrosine derived hormones: thyroid hormone and catecholamines. Thyroid hormone is one of the most important in the body because it regulates the development of organs and metabolism. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are catecholamines. Both are stress hormones and are also neurotransmitters.ther examples include LH (lutenizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). LH acts on the gonads to produce eggs and sperm while FSH stimulates the gonads to produce steroids. Non-tropic hormones behave in an opposite manner.

where is your circumflex artery located	The two main coronary arteries are the left and right coronary arteries. The left coronary artery (LCA), which divides into the left anterior descending artery and the circumflex branch, supplies blood to the heart ventricles and left atrium. These include the following: 1  circumflex artery (Cx). 2  The circumflex artery branches off the left coronary artery and encircles the heart muscle. 3  left anterior descending artery (LAD). 4  The left anterior descending artery branches off the left coronary artery and supplies blood to the front of the heart.The two main coronary arteries are the left main and right coronary arteries. Left main coronary artery (LMCA). The left main coronary artery supplies blood to the left side of the heart muscle (the left ventricle and left atrium). The left main coronary divides into branches: The left anterior descending artery, which branches off the left coronary artery and supplies blood to the front of the left side of the heart. The circumflex artery, which branches off the left coronary artery and encircles the heart muscle. This artery supplies blood to the outer side and back of the heart. Right coronary artery (RCA). The right coronary artery supplies blood to the right ventricle, the right atrium, and the SA (sinoatrial) and AV (atrioventricular) nodes, which regular the heart rhythm.

triglyceride level range for children	The American College of Sports Medicine reports that normal triglyceride levels for children under the age of 18 are less than 150 mg/dL. Borderline high, high and very high triglyceride levels are measured at 150 to 199 mg/dL, 200 to 499 mg/dL, and greater than 500 mg/dL, respectively. In fact, the American Heart Association notes that current rates of overweight and obese children and adolescents have tripled in the last 50 years. It should come as no surprise, then, that some children have begun to develop chronic health conditions -- like high triglyceride levels -- much earlier than expected. Identifying normal triglyceride levels is crucial for parents who want to ensure the health and longevity of their childrenThe bulk of your adolescent's body fat tissue is in the form of triglycerides. The link between triglycerides and heart disease is under clinical investigation. However, many children and adolescents with high triglyceride levels also have other risk factors such as high LDL levels or low HDL levels. However, your child's liver can make all of the cholesterol your child's body needs. Cholesterol and other fats are transported through the blood stream in the form of round particles called lipoproteins. The two most commonly known lipoproteins are low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL).

what is a kapok tree	Botany: A giant in the rainforests, the kapok tree can reach up to 200 feet in height, sometimes growing as much as 13 feet per year. Due to its extreme height, the kapok, or ceiba tree, towers over the other rainforest vegetation. The trunk can expand to nine or 10 feet in diameter. In the nooks and grooves of this huge plant live a diverse number of species including frogs, birds and bromeliads. The kapok tree is deciduous, shedding all of its leaves during the dry season. As its seeds are easily blown into open areas, kapok trees are some of the first to colonize open areas in the forest. The white and pink flowers of the kapok tree emit a foul odor that attracts bats.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Ceiba pentandra or the Kapok is a species of tropical trees of the order Malvales and the family Malvaceae (previously separated in the family Bombacaceae), native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, northern South America, and (as the variety Ceiba pentandra var. The word is also used for the fibre obtained from its seed pods. The tree is also known as the Java cotton, Java kapok, or ceiba. It is a sacred symbol in Maya mythology.

what is myelin and what is its function human body test	Myelin is a fatty material that coats, protects, and insulates nerves, enabling them to quickly conduct impulses between the brain and different parts of the body. Myelin also contains proteins that can be targeted by the immune system. Myelin coats the nerves of both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system; the destruction of the myelin in the central nervous system is what triggers many of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). T cells from the body's own immune system attack and destroy the myelin sheath Click to view larger image. In multiple sclerosis, T cells from the body's own immune system attack and destroy the myelin sheath, leaving the nerve cell fibers unprotected.Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a protein believed to be important in the process of myelination of nerves in the nervous system. The myelin sheath is a multi-layered membrane, unique to the nervous system, that functions as an insulator to greatly increase the velocity of axonal impulse conduction. MBP maintains the correct structure of myelin, interacting with the lipids in the myelin membrane. The protein encoded by the classic MBP gene is a major constituent of the myelin sheath of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in the nervous system. However, MBP-related transcripts are also present in the bone marrow and the immune system.
cost of offshore rig	Swamp barge: 10 to 100 millions $ Jack up (shallow offshore) : 75 to 175 millions Semi submersible (deep offshore) : from 100 for an old one to 400 millions $ to build a new one Drillship: 300 to 500 millions $ to build a new one. This is to build or buy. I buy used offshore rigs for salvage. It is a very difficult business. You can purchase a 100 million dollar decommissioned rig for 3 million to 5 million cash. Now that is just the beginning.Average costs vary widely between different types of oil rigs, starting at around $20 million and ranging as high as close to $1 billion. The cost of oil rigs and drilling equipment invariably represents a very large capital expenditure for an oil producer. International land rigs, designed to meet a wider range of specifications that vary from one country to another, generally range from $25 million to $40 million. The average cost for offshore rigs can be as much as 15 to 20 times greater than the average cost for land rigs. The least-expensive offshore rigs typically cost nearly $200 million. The average price for offshore oil-drilling rigs is approximately $650 million. The Brazilian energy company Petrobas, in a plan to replace leased U.S. and European rigs with its own fleet of offshore floating rigs, recently began producing offshore rigs estimated to cost up to $900 million each
how much does a person pay for gas a month	If you’re like a majority of the respondents of a recent GasBuddy.com poll, you spend at least $101 each month in order to fill up your car. For most of us, that doesn’t seem like a whole heck of a lot, but for people who are just making it by, that’s a whole lot of money. I don’t care who you are, what kind of job you have, whatever, $3,600 is a lot of money to blow on gas each year. Unfortunately, it appears that things will only get worse in the future (here comes the political commentary) as we haven’t built a new refinery in this country in the last 30 years.The national average for gas spending is about $220 a month and married couples my age with kids tend to spend about $250. That’s interesting, but how does my personal gas spending stack up? Unfortunately, we’re above average, even for our particular location. We typically spend right around $275-$290 each month on gas. It makes sense that people in our area spend more than the national average because it’s one of the most rural counties in the state. Since I move 1hour away from my job I spend about $400 in gas a month. It's a huge expense but it's the price to pay to have a nice house and a big land... I honestly don't even drive my car anywhere aside from work and school. The occasional run to the mall or somewhere for dinner. My gas price is about $90 each month.

Proof: Let the parallelogram be ABCD with perpendicular diagonals AC and BD intersecting at P : The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, so triangles APB and CPB are congruent by SAS.
where is the show the vikings filmed	Morgan O’Sullivan, Managing Director of World 2000 Productions. Historical drama Vikings has been given a third series and will continue to film on location in County Wicklow, Ireland, with a base at Ashford Studios outside Dublin. The show was History Channel’s first scripted series and tells the story of the infamous Nordic race. Vikings occupies all the stages at Ashford (below) and uses standing sets for the drama’s historic settings. Around 40% of the series is filmed on location and a Viking village set has been built nearby on a private estate owned by the studio’s founder Joe O’Connell.For the 2012 BBC Documentary series, see Vikings (TV documentary series) .

Vikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France. The show portrays Ragnar as a former farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes king of Denmark, with the support of his family and fellow warriors: his brother Rollo, his son Bjorn Ironside, and his wives—the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the princess Aslaug.
what does std mean on a breathalyzer	After an arrest for DUI in the greater Las Vegas area, the arresting officer will typically ask you to submit to a breath test on a machine called the Intoxilyzer 5000EN at the Clark County Detention Center, City of Las Vegas Detention Center, Henderson Detention Center or any other jail facility. An experienced Las Vegas DUI attorney can contest the accuracy and reliability of your DUI breath test results by showing flaws in the inspection and calibration process that affect the machine's margin of error.Probable cause means the officer has a valid reason to believe you committed a crime. One way to establish probable cause is to administer a breathalyzer test. A breathalyzer test uses a small, portable device known as a breathalyzer. This device has been approved for use by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. For the breathalyzer test, the officer will ask you to breath into the device. Refusing the Breathalyzer Test. The consequences of refusing a breathalyzer test can be severe depending on your state's laws. If you do refuse to take a breathalyzer test, you may have your license automatically suspended from 90 days all the way up to a year. Not only that, but you will be prosecuted for drunk driving and be subject to the usual types of DUI punishment, which may include fines, jail time, and community ser
what means cbc blood test	Guide. A complete blood count (CBC) gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in the blood, especially red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A CBC helps your doctor check any symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, or bruising, you may have. A CBC also helps him or her diagnose conditions, such as anemia, infection, and many other disorders. A CBC test usually includes: 1  White blood cell (WBC, leukocyte) count. 2  White blood cells protect the body against infection. 3  If an infection develops, white blood cells attack and destroy the bacteria, virus, or other organism causing it. 4  White blood cells are bigger than red blood cells but fewer in number. Definition. A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection and leukemia. A complete blood count test measures several components and features of your blood, including: 1  Red blood cells, which carry oxygen. 2  White blood cells, which fight infection.

what type of weather in india	by admin / on November 4, 2009 at 4:22 pm /. Weather in India varies from moderate to the extreme of climates. The northern part of India experiences the coldest of winters and in the south one comes across the hottest of summers. Tourists can plan out their itinerary at any time of the season, as the weather conditions vary from region to region. Basic Structure of the Indian Weather. Differing Climates. In the Northern part of India, the winters are severe. The Himalayan range experiences snowfall and many people visit Kashmir and Shimla to experience the snowfall. The winter is very severe in the northern part of India during the months of November to January. Of course in the south of India, the winters are milder during this season. In fact the daytime heat will be very warm and soothingMichael Coyne/Getty Images. The weather in India varies dramatically. While the southern tip of the India is being lashed by tropical monsoon rain, the north will be blanketed in thick snow. Therefore, the best time to travel to India depends greatly on the destinations to be visited and the climate experienced there. Indian weather itself is divided into three distinct seasons -- winter, summer, and the monsoon. Generally, the best time to visit India is during the winter, when the weather in most places is relatively cool and pleasant.
what type of rocks are sauna stones	The best sauna rocks are actually igneous rocks which come from cooled lava. Yes, that does cover a variety of rocks from granite (which are too heavy) to pumice (too light), but there exists a special type of dark-colored volcanic rocks which are juuust right. The Rocks and your Sauna Heater. Once you have the right stones, you must remember not to operate the heater without the rocks in the tray. Size is important too. The sauna rocks should be about the size of your fist or a large potato. Loosely place the rocks around, between, and on top of the sauna heater’s elements. Take care, however, not to force the rocks between the elements. They should pack close enough together so that water doesn’t pool on the heater elementsTypes of stove stones: - Olivine diabase: The most traditional and the most common stove rock. It is robust and has good heat storage capacity. The crushed natural stone can potentially discharge dust and gases into the air when hot. They have been used in all types of heaters. The bigger stove types require larger stones. In the past the most commonly used stove stones were made of granite or stones found by lakes or rivers. Granite rock, however, has a tendency to crumble at a relatively low temperature of 300 degrees. The thermal capacity of lake stones is fairly low and the heat conductivity is poor.

the need for coordination between the subunits of a firm is	Firms use integrating mechanisms to help achieve coordination between subunits. The need for coordination (and hence integrating mechanisms) varies with firm strategy. This need is lowest in multidomestic firms, higher in international firms, higher still in global firms, and highest in transnational firms. A central theme of the chapter was that different strategies require different structures and control systems. To succeed, a firm must match its structure and controls to its strategy in discriminating ways. Firms whose structure and controls do not fit their strategic requirements will experience performance probleChapter 13 The Organization of International Business. True / False Questions. 1. (p. 450) As long as a firm's strategy is in line with the competitive environment, it is not necessary for the strategy to be consistent with the organizational architecture. FALSE. Difficulty: Medium. 2. (p. 451) Organizational structure refers to the totality of a firm's organization. 97. (p. 451) Explain organizational structure. A firm's organizational structure refers to three things. First, the term refers to the formal division of the organization into subunits such as product divisions, national operations and functions. Second, the term refers to the location of decision-making responsibilities within the formal structure

What's the contagious period for a cold from one person to another?	Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, sore throat, and headache are common symptoms of flu. Not everyone with flu will have a fever. The flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually comes on suddenly. Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. Symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body. Information about how long a person is contagious is available at How Flu Spreads.First, scientists involved with common cold research do not know exactly how long a person with a cold is contagious. Based on previous studies, their best guess is that a person becomes contagious about two to three days before developing the usual symptoms of a cold. Second, this contagious period can last until the person no longer shows any symptoms. So in theory, a person is contagious for about two weeks. (Click Cold Symptoms to read about the symptoms of the common cold or Cold and Flu Symptoms to learn the difference between a cold and the flu.). Let's assume you're the one with the cold. During the two-week period when you're contagious, research indicates that you'll be most likely to transmit the cold virus when you're experiencing cold symptoms. The period when you're most contagious is when your symptoms are at their worst -- day 2 to day 4 of the cold.
what did phillis wheatley write about	SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: One day, one of the slaves in the Wheatley home found Phillis writing on the wall of Mr. Wheatley's room with a piece of coal. Phillis had been cleaning the dust from a book. She decided to copy the letters from the cover of the book. The slave brought Mr. Wheatley to inspect the marks on the wall. But Susannah Wheatley did not get angry. Instead, she smiled. Mr. Wheatley gave Phillis a pencil and paper and a little table on which to write. She showed the writing on the wall to her daughter Mary. Mary was as surprised as her mother at how well Phillis had copied the letters. Mary told Phillis she would teach her to write -- on paper, not on walls. RAY FREEMAN: Mary Wheatley began to teach Phillis to read and write English. She also taught Phillis the Christian religion.An engraving of poet Phillis Wheatley from her book, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral. Phillis Wheatley, the First African American Published Book of Poetry. September 1, 1773. Phillis Wheatley was only seven or eight years old when she was captured and taken from her home in West Africa. A slave ship brought her to Boston in 1761. Knowing nothing of the talents she would soon show the world, John Wheatley, a prosperous tailor, and his wife, Susanna, purchased the young girl directly from the ship and named her Phillis Wheatley.

what is idiopathic nephrotic syndrome	Weight gain from excess fluid. The type of nephrotic syndrome that is most common in children is called idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. It accounts for about 90 percent of children with nephrotic syndrome. Idiopathic means that a disease occurs with no known cause. The most common type of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is called minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is more common in boys than girls. With MCNS, the child usually has relapses of the illness, but the disease can usually be managed and prognosis is good.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the following symptoms that result from changes that occur to the small, functional structures in the kidneys, such as: Very high levels of protein in the urine. Low levels of protein in the blood due to its loss in the urine.
what is gas hydrate	Gas hydrates are also important for seafloor stability studies, because melting gas hydrate may cause seafloor land slides. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Methane released from gas hydrate may therefore play a significant role in climate change3. It is important to distinguish between the climate change aspects of methane released naturally from gas hydrates and those of methane produced from gas hydrates for energy use. The gas hydrate stability zone extends into the seafloor sediments down to a depth where temperature exceeds gas hydrate stability, usually some 10s to 100s of meters beneath the seafloor. At this depth, thin methane gas layers are often present causing strong reflections in seismic records.Clathrate hydrates (or gas clathrates, gas hydrates, clathrates, hydrates, etc.) are crystalline water-based solids physically resembling ice, in which small non-polar molecules (typically gases) or polar molecules with large hydrophobic moieties are trapped inside cages of hydrogen bonded, frozen water molecules. In other words, clathrate hydrates are clathrate compounds in which the host molecule is water and the guest molecule is typically a gas or liquid. Without the support of the trapped molecules, the lattice structure of hydrate clathrates would collapse into conventional ice crystal structure or liquid water
how much does a new firefighter make	Firefighters' salaries vary according to experience and location of the job. Full-time firefighters earned an average $47,720 per year, as of May 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The lowest-paid made less than $22,480 a year, while the highest-paid received over $75,520 per year. Employers. Over 90 percent of the nation’s 304,080 firefighters worked for local government, including municipal and county fire departments, where salaries averaged $48,450 per year, as of 2011. The highest pay was in computer systems design and related services, with wages at $69,280 a year, according to the BLS.The BLS reports that about 90 percent of the 304,080 firefighters employed as of May 2011 worked for municipal and county fire departments. Average wages here were $48,450 a year. The highest pay came from computer systems design companies, where the mean annual salary was $69,280 per year. Salaries By State. California employed the most firefighters of the 50 states as of May 2011. It also paid the highest average salaries, at $71,030 a year. Texas ranked second in the number of jobs and paid its firefighters $45,530 a year on average. In terms of the nation's highest pay, New Jersey ranked second at an average of $70,160 a year. It was followed by Washington at an average of $63,040 and New York at an average of $61,240
how much protein should you eat per meal	Giving elderly women 80% of their protein for the day at one meal over a period of two weeks led to almost 20% more synthesis and retention of protein compared to dividing it into smaller doses. So it appears that daily total protein is more important than per-meal protein. A good rule of thumb for daily intake, and a safe range based on the literature, is 0.8–2.5 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For muscular gain, I suggest at least 1.25 grams per pound of current lean bodyweight, which means you subtract your bodyfat ﬁrst. There's a popular (mis)belief that the human body can't absorb more than 30 grams of protein per meal. The science refutes this. Researchers in France have found that eating protein all at once can be just as well absorbed as spreading it out over your day.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recommended dietary allowance for protein for women over the age of 14 is 46 grams of protein. Teenage boys, on the other hand, should have a daily intake of 52 grams of protein, while adult men require 56 grams of protein. The CDC also states, however, that as much as 35 percent of the total calories for the day may derive from protein sources. A 2,000 calorie diet, for instance, would equate to 175 grams of protein each day, or approximately 60 grams of protein at each meal.
what is fiberboard	Plywood is not a type of fiberboard, as it is made of thin sheets of wood, not wood fibers or particles. Fiberboard, particularly medium-density fiberboard (MDF), is heavily used in the furniture industry. For pieces that will be visible, a veneer of wood is often glued onto fiberboard to give it the appearance of conventional wood. Fiberboard is also used in the auto industry to create free-form shapes such as dashboards, rear parcel shelves, and inner door shells. These pieces are usually covered with a skin, foil, or fabric such as cloth, suede, leather, or polyvinyl chlorideFiberboard (American spelling) or fibreboard (Commonwealth spelling) is a type of engineered wood product that is made out of wood fibers. Types of fiberboard (in order of increasing density) include particle board, medium-density fiberboard, and hardboard. Fiberboard is sometimes used as a synonym for particle board, but particle board usually refers to low-density fiberboard. For pieces that will be visible, a veneer of wood is often glued onto fiberboard to give it the appearance of conventional wood. Fiberboard is also used in the auto industry to create free-form shapes such as dashboards, rear parcel shelves, and inner door shells.

are kale chips healthy	Kale chips in general are just as beneficial as eating kale in a salad or anything else—and they can be a good starter for people who aren’t so keen on the green’s tough texture and occasional bitterness. And, contrary to rumor, cooking kale does not take away its nutritional benefits. In other words, it totally defeats the purpose. Some packaged chips have 10 grams of fat and over 200 milligrams of sodium per serving. If you make your own, you can cut the fat content by at least half—and you control the salt. Here is Gomer’s totally easy, totally delicious, totally healthy kale chip recipe.Kale has many health benefits, from weight management to healthy eyesight. If you’re looking for a healthy and tasty way to cook kale, try whipping up some kale chips. These are very easy to make by tossing chopped kale in a small amount of olive oil and then baking the chips in the oven until they are crispy. Heart Health. Kale contains no cholesterol and no unhealthy saturated or trans fats making it a good choice for cardiovascular health. The olive oil you use in making the kale chips is a good source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. When monounsaturated fats are consumed in place of saturated fats or refined carbohydrates, they can help to lower your LDL -- or “bad” -- cholesterol and raise your HDL -- or “good” -- cholesterol
what tree does a genet live in	Genet Habits. The genet has adapted to a variety of habitats within its range. It can live in semi-desert, forest, scrubland, grassland, and savannah. During the day the genet sleeps in hollow trees or crevices. Its spotted fur provides good camouflage, so that it blends in wit the surroundings. Active by night, the genet seems to return to the same lair near dawn everyday. Genet In southern parts of the genet's range, the female may bear two litters a year. The female makes a nest in a hollow tree or among rocks, and the young are born there. They are blind at birth but open their eyes after 5 to 12 days. Their mother provides solid food for them at two months of age.Since your genet will be living indoors anyway, its exposure to other animals and possible viruses will be extremely limited.. For other uses, see Genet (disambiguation) . A genet (pronounced /ˈdʒɛnɪt/ or /dʒəˈnɛt/) is a member of the genus Genetta, which comprises 14 to 17 species of small African carnivorans. Genets can be socialized with cats and dogs, but they attack small animal pets. They are not cuddly pets, and don't do well in groups of genets but usually get along with dogs and cats if they have grown up with them. Smaller pets, like hamsters, quickly become food to a genet.. Genets are a ONE family pet, there is no such thing as rehoming a pet genet
what causes adrenal cortical carcinoma	1 Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the outer layer of the adrenal gland. 2  Having certain genetic conditions increases the risk of adrenocortical carcinoma. 3  Symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include pain in the abdomen. After adrenocortical carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the adrenal gland or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the adrenal gland or to other parts of the body is called staging.Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease. It is caused by a cancerous growth in the adrenal cortex, which is the outer layer of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands lie on top of the kidneys. They play an important role in the endocrine system, which is the system that makes and regulates hormones. ACC is also known as adrenocortical carcinoma. The adrenal cortex makes hormones that regulate metabolism and blood pressure. It also produces cortisol and the male hormones known as androgens. Treating an Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan based on your condition, sex, age and overall physical health. He may also stage your cancer. Staging tells your doctor how advanced your cancer is. This can help determine the right treatment.
what types of consumers are reptiles	Again, self teaching is how I became an expert. Different reptiles are different types of consumers. For example, iguanas are primary consumers because they eat vegetation. Other reptiles, like Komodo dragons or Gila monsters, are secondary because they eat primary consumers. Some reptiles, like thorny devil lizards, eat secondary consumers (in the case of thorny devils these are red ants), and therefor they would be a third level consumer. The type of consumers there are is primary consumers. They feed on plants. Secondary consumers is the next one. They feed on primary consumers. The last one are tertiary consu … mers. They feed on the secondary consumers. Everybody depends on the plants or producers. However some us other names.The Saurischia (lizard-hipped): the termcomes from sauria, meaning reptile, and ischia, referring to the ischium bone of the pelvis. These dinosaurs had a pelvis built like that of many other reptiles, hence the name lizard-hipped dinosaurs. From them evolved the other major group of dinosaurs. The only living anapsids are the turtles and tortoises (see figure below). The synapsids: or mammal-like reptiles have a single temporal opening low on the side of the skull, beneath the postorbital and squamosal bones. They are extinct but very important because mammals evolved from this group of reptiles.

average time to walk a mile for a woman	“High” fitness women ran the mile in nine minutes or less; “moderate” fitness women ran it in 10 minutes and 30 seconds or less and “low” fitness women needed 12 minutes or more to complete the mile. Run for Life states that a 10-minute mile rate is good for beginners; the goal is to complete 3 miles in 30 minutes. Your mile rate is more of an average; for example, if you run 3 miles in 24 minutes, the rate is eight minutes per mile. Keeping up a steady pace over extended lengths might have more payoffs for you than achieving a brisk mile and then being unable to complete additional miles.Men who complete a mile in more than 8 1/2 minutes and women who complete a mile in more than 10 1/2 minutes are considered to be in the lowest level of fitness. Men who complete a mile in less than seven minutes and women who complete a mile in less than 8 minutes, 31 seconds, are considered the most fit. The Air Force requires that men jog or run 1 1/2 miles in no more than 13 minutes, 45 seconds and women to women to do it in no more than 16 minutes to pass basic training. Determining a good time for jogging a mile depends on several factors, including your age and physical condition. If you're young and in top shape, a good time would be faster than if you're older and just trying to get in shape. Men, typically, jog faster than women.
what is vascular tissue in a plant	The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant. The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells.Vascular plants (from Latin vasculum: duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term trachea) and also higher plants, form a large group of plants that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. 1 Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. 2  This feature allows vascular plants to evolve to a larger size than non-vascular plants, which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are therefore restricted to relatively small sizes.
what cholesterol is	LDL cholesterol sometimes is called “bad” cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.). HDL cholesterol sometimes is called “good” cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. The higher the level of HDL cholesterol in your blood, the LOWER your chance is of getting heart disease. Coronary heart disease is a condition in which plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood.Cholesterol is a waxy substance that comes from two sources: your body and food. Your body, and especially your liver, makes all the cholesterol you need and circulates it through the blood. But cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as meat, poultry and full-fat dairy products. Your liver produces more cholesterol when you eat a diet high in saturated and trans fats. Excess cholesterol can form plaque between layers of artery walls, making it harder for your heart to circulate blood. Plaque can break open and cause blood clots. If a clot blocks an artery that feeds the brain, it causes a stroke. If it blocks an artery that feeds the heart, it causes a heart attack.
how do gas fumes affect you	Gas fumes affect certain regions of the brain, especially when people use inhalants repeatedly. Memory becomes distorted and the person may have difficulty remembering things or even carrying on simple conversations, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.nhaling gases and other chemicals can result in harmful and irreversible damage. Degenerative diseases of the nervous system and permanent limb spasms may result from inhaling gasoline, gas cylinders and whipped cream dispensers. Brain damage and muscle weakness may result.Before dealing with the removal of gasoline fumes, you should know what it can do to your health. The fumes, once inhaled for long periods, can damage your respiratory system, particularly your lungs. They can also affect your brain, causing hallucinations after prolonged exposure.Gasoline smell is clearly dangerous, so you should get rid of it at the soonest time possible. Gasoline, composed of harmful chemicals, leaves a pretty strong odor, even at the slightest contact. A damaged item can emit gas, which is just as dangerous as gasoline fumes. 2  Leave it to the Mechanic-If gasoline fumes are constantly emitted through the air-conditioning system, deodorizers and ionizers won't be of much help. 3  Prevent your car from being a portable gas chamber by having it checked in a car repair shop.
what is difference between sinus infection and cold	Cold vs Sinus Infection. Cold or common cold (acute coryza, acute viral rhinopharyngitis, and upper respiratory infection) is a viral infection that is contagious. This infection is caused by the coronavirus or the rhinovirus. Cold is one of the most common conditions of infection amongst humans. 2. The coronavirus or the rhinovirus causes cold whereas sinus infection can be caused by viral, fungal, bacterial and allergic stimuli. 3. Common cold persists for 5 days whereas sinus infection can lead to 7-10 days of suffering. 4. Common cold doesn’t cause fever whereas sinus infection causes fever.Another common point of distinction between a common cold infection and a sinus infection is that, common colds produce clear mucus in the form of nasal discharge. But bacterial sinus infections cause the discharge of yellowish or greenish mucus and may at times also contain traces of pus. Summary: 1. Common cold is a contagious viral infection whereas sinus infection is a condition of infection and inflammation of paranasal sinuses. 2. The coronavirus or the rhinovirus causes cold whereas sinus infection can be caused by viral, fungal, bacterial and allergic stimuli. 3.

causes of hemoglobin in urine	1 Sickle cell anemia — a hereditary defect of hemoglobin in red blood cells — can be the cause of blood in urine, both visible and microscopic hematuria. 2  So can Alport syndrome, which affects the filtering membranes in the glomeruli of the kidneys. 3  Kidney injury. In hematuria, your kidneys — or other parts of your urinary tract — allow blood cells to leak into urine. A number of problems can cause this leakage, including: Urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections often occur when bacteria enter your body through the urethra and begin to multiply in your bladder.Hemoglobin is the red pigmented, oxygen-carrying protein found in red blood cells. When hemoglobin is present in the urine, it is termed hemoglobinuria. Certain conditions and diseases can result in red blood cell destruction within the bloodstream. As the level of free hemoglobin rises, it becomes detectable in the urine. Laboratory analysis is used to confirm the presence of hemoglobinuria. The bacteria usually ascend from the genital area through the urinary tract to the kidneys. Sometimes the infection develops from a different infection somewhere else in the body. Kidney infections can cause bleeding within the kidney, resulting in red blood cells and hemoglobin in the urine. Symptoms usually include flank pain, fever, chills, nausea and vomiting

what is a horse laminae	Laminitis is a condition of the foot that can become very painful in horses. It is when the coffin bone and the inner hoof wall begin to separate from each other. The coffin bone is attached to the hoof wall by two interlocking layers of connecting tissues called laminae. If the tissues for whatever reason get inflamed or the blood supply is disturbed then the attachment between the laminae will fail and the hoof wall will become separated from the rest of the foot.Laminitis inflammation of the laminae (the inside lining of the hoof) Lead change The lead is the foreleg of the horse that is farthest in front during a canter. A good rider can signal the horse to change his lead. Lope A slow canter, used mostly in Western disciplines. Laminae -- Membrane lining the hoof, some of which contain the blood vessels that feed the hoof, that attaches the hoof to the bones. Navicular -- Boat-shaped bone behind the coffin bone. Pastern -- Part of the leg between the coronet and the fetlock. laminae-A part of the hoof. See insensitive laminae and sensitive laminae. ...

How long does it take for a broken shoulder blade to heal?	A broken collarbone, or fractured clavicle, is a common injury. It usually happens after a fall or a blow to the shoulder. It takes about six to eight weeks to heal in adults, and three to six weeks in children. The collarbone, or clavicle, is a long slender bone that runs from the breastbone to each of the shoulders. However, it will take at least the same period again to restore full strength to your shoulder. While the fracture heals, a lump may develop along the collarbone. This is normal and often improves over the following months. Occasionally, the fracture doesn't heal (non-union) and you may need to have surgery.A broken shoulder is most commonly a fractured humerus. A fracture is the medical term for a broken bone. The humerus is your upper arm bone between your shoulder and elbow. When your humerus is fractured near or at the ball of your shoulder joint, it is commonly known as a broken shoulder. Your humerus can be broken in many places and the fracture is normally described by its location eg a fractured neck of humerus. Please Note: fractured is the medical term for a broken bone. General Advice for Broken Shoulder. After a broken shoulder you will have dramatic bruising down your arm as far as the elbow. This is normal. The bruising will take many days to disappear. This is a common injury in older patients.

cost to fill in a pool	Ordering Your Fill. Swimming pools are fairly deep, and require large amounts of material to fill. That is why you want to purchase a low cost fill, topsoil will be needed, but only for the surface layer. Our fill is $12.00 per cubic yard. We have another material call tailings which cost only $5.00 per cubic yard. Tailings are small stones that are a byproduct of our topsoil screening process. For example if our pool is 30′ long, 20′ wide’ and 6′ deep, it has a total volume of 3,600 square feet (30x20x6). The total square footage divided by 27 is 133.33, this indicates that your pool will need 133.33 cubic yards of material to fill it in.When we first moved in, I had given a cursory look into filling in the pool, and that cost was approximately $10,000. Hmmmmm $15,000 to fix a pool we seldom used + the $3000 yearly costs, versus $10,000 to fill it in and be done with the headache and regain a portion of our yard. Seemed like a no-brainer to me! Well, over the course of the winter hubby ruminated on the idea. When I got a quote of $9,900 to fill in the pool, I said “sold.” We have a young son, but in our case, the pool either had to be completely rehabbed or we had to fill it – and with filling being less than half the cost of a rehab…and with us hoping to send our son to college one day…that pretty much made our decision.
the effects of boiling broccoli	Researchers studied the effects of boiling, steaming, microwave cooking and stir-fry cooking on fresh broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green cabbage. Boiling led to the biggest losses of cancer-fighting nutrients. In general, broccoli is safe to eat, and any side effects are not serious. The most common side effect is gas or bowel irritation, caused by broccoli's high amounts of fiber. All cruciferous vegetables can make you gassy, Jarzabkowski said.And while many people think microwaving is bad for food, vegetables cooked in a microwave may have a higher concentration of certain vitamins. A March 2007 study looked at the effects of boiling, steaming, microwaving and pressure cooking on the nutrients in broccoli. Steaming and boiling caused a 22 percent to 34 percent loss of vitamin C. Microwaved and pressure-cooked vegetables retained 90 percent of their vitamin C. The bottom line is that no one cooking or preparation method is superior for preserving 100 percent of the nutrients in a vegetable. Fat-soluble compounds like vitamins A, D, E and K and the antioxidant compounds called carotenoids fare better during cooking and processing. A report in The Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry concluded that over all, boiling was better for carrots, zucchini and broccoli than steaming, frying or serving them raw.
how does smooth muscle contraction differ from skeletal muscle	Contraction in skeletal muscle begins with a nerve impulse-acetlycholine is released at the neuromuscular junction and binds to receptors in the muscle. This causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This calcium then binds to troponin, causing tropomyosin to move and allowing cross-bridges to form between the myosin and actin filaments. The actin is then pulled (slides) across the myosin. Unlike skeletal muscle, there is no neuromuscular junction or troponin in smooth muscle. Instead, contraction is started by the release of neurotransmitter vesicles (membrane bound containers) into the space between the cells. In smooth muscle calcium acts directly on the myosin head-causing cross-bridges to form. The muscle then contractsYour body is composed of three types of muscle: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle makes up 40 percent of your total body weight, and smooth muscle and cardiac muscle each make up 5 percent of total body weight. Your muscles must contract in order to facilitate vital bodily functions. Although skeletal muscles and smooth muscles serve very different functions, both muscle groups use the same mechanism of contraction called the sliding filament model. Both muscle fibers are composed of thick filaments called myosin and thin filaments called actin

how long does lpc last	LPC. There is a time limit of five years between starting and finishing the LPC. To repeat, you must complete the LPC within five years of beginning it. We also advise you to check that your qualifications are recognised by the Solicitors Regulation Authority or Bar Standards Board. Once you have completed a law degree or the GDL, there is no time limit on the validity of either for starting the LPC. To be clear, under the current rules it would be absolutely fine to take the LPC 10 or even 15 years after graduating from your law degree or GDL.The Legal Practice Course (LPC) – also known as the Postgraduate Diploma in Legal Practice – is the final vocational stage for becoming a solicitor in England and Wales. The course is designed to provide a bridge between academic study and training in a law firm. It is a one-year, full-time (or two-year, part-time) course, and tuition fees range from £8,000-£14,550 a year. A small proportion of students may have their fees and some living expenses paid for by future employers under a training contract. It is not uncommon for law firms to provide sponsorship to LPC students as part of a job offer. Generally sponsorship is only offered by wealthy commercial practices, although a limited number of legal aid sponsorship packages (funded by the Law Society of England and Wales) do exist.
who is nan shepherd	Nan (Anna) Shepherd (1893 – 1981). Anna Shepherd, also known as Nan, was born on February 11 th 1893 in East Peterculter at Westerton Cottage close to Aberdeen in the North-East of Scotland. Nan was an author, college teacher, an avid mountain climber. Not only did Shepherd write poems and author books she also edited different magazines. Shepherd was born to John and Jane Smith Shepherd, and was the second child of John who was a civil engineer. Other family members in Shepherd’s family also held respectable occupations.It was a pilgrimage and not an attack.. Macfarlane says Nan Shepherd was in love with what she called the tang of height. She wrote: Summer on the high plateau can be as delectable as honey; it can also be a roaring scourge. To those who love the place, both are good, since both are part of its essential nature. And it is to know its essential nature that I am seeking here.. Image caption Robert Macfarlane travels in the footsteps of Nan Shepherd. According to Macfarlane, two beautiful ideas emerge from Nan Shepherd's book. Shepherd wrote: Often the mountain gives itself most completely when I have no destination but have gone out merely to be with the mountain as one visits a friend, with no intention but to be with him.. Nan Shepherd was born in the village of Cults on the outskirts of Aberdeen in 1893.
what does carbonated mean	Carbonated beverages are drinks that include carbon dioxide dissolved in water. The presence of this gas creates bubbles and fizzing in the liquid. Carbonation can occur naturally underground or artificially, through pressurizing. Examples of carbonated beverages include spring water, beer and soda, or pop. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a compound made of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. Beverages are artificially carbonated when carbon dioxide is dissolved into the liquid under high pressure. When that pressure is released, small gas bubbles develop. Carbonation can also occur naturally when carbon dioxide gas is dissolved into a liquid, such as in spring water, which absorbs CO 2 underground. Beer is another naturally carbonated beverage, because carbon dioxide is created during the fermentation processAnd what can you do if a beer is over-or under-carbonated? Carbonation levels The amount of carbon dioxide in a beer can usefully be described in terms of the volumes of CO2,i.e. how many volumes of CO2 (at atmospheric pressure) are dissolved in one volume of beer.This terminology is familiar to those who keg. Carbonation (Keg and Bottle) and Serving beer from a Keg Effect of Temperature and Pressure when dissolving CO2 in beer The amount of CO 2 that can be dissolved in a liquid is a function of temperature and pressure.

what is a gift tax exclusion	By treating it as a split gift, you can completely shelter the gift with your $14,000 exclusion plus your spouse’s $14,000 exclusion. That way no gift tax is due, and the gift doesn't reduce the $5.34 million lifetime gift tax exemption in effect for 2014 or the estate tax exemption for you or your spouse. The lifetime exclusion will be raised to $5.34 million starting in 2014. If you’re married, your spouse is entitled to a separate $5.43 million in 2015. So actually owing the gift tax is not a concern for most folks. But you may still have to file gift tax returns even though you don’t owe any tax.Annual Gift Exclusion. In 2014, you may give someone up to $14,000 in gifts before paying any gift tax. The $14,000 annual gift exclusion is a limit on nontaxable gifts per person, and you may give multiple people up to $14,000 each without incurring any tax liability. However, the amounts of your annual gift exclusions are limited to a lifetime total of $5,3400 ($10,680,000 for married couples for Tax Year 2014. Gift Taxes-What You Need to Know: If you give someone a gift or gifts of money or property and the value is over the annual gift exclusion amount, you will generally owe gift taxes. If you give a gift of property, taxes must be paid on the fair market value of the item (not the purchase price, nor the original value).
the german term for the art song is	Here’s art song’s brief description: a poem set to music, usually for trained voice and piano with a duration of about three minutes. Other English words are solo song, art-song, artsong, classical song, piano song etc. In German the word for such classical song is Lied (singular) and Lieder (plural). It is the German practice to capitalize their nouns. Yes, there are art songs with orchestra etc., but that will do for a beginning. You already know at least one art song, Brahms’ Lullaby. The first verse is taken from a collection of German folk poems called Des Knaben Wunderhorn; the second stanza was written by Georg Scherer (1824 – 1909) in 1849. .There are over 600 Franz Schubert songs, which the composer penned in his short life. Schubert was a master of the genre. The proper name for the Franz Schubert songs is actually lieder, which is just the German word for song. It describes this particular type of classical art song, which has a singer accompanied by piano. Schubert had a huge impact on the lieder genre. It has two obvious parts: one to represent the Maiden, which has agitated music, and a very sombre section which is Death's music. 1  An die Musik (To Music), D547. 2  A cozy-sounding little song, which praises the art of music. 3  It's one of Schubert's most popular art songs. 4  Die Forelle (The Trout), D550.
what is the size of a butterfly needle?	Phlebotomy Periprocedural Care - Patient Preparation. 1  To alleviate potential anxiety, approach the patient in a professional, calm, and confident manner. If the patient is very anxious about the pain he or she expects to feel, a topical anesthetic cream may be applied 1 hour before phlebotomy.Butterfly Needles Explained A butterfly needle, also known as a scalp vein set or a winged infusion set, is a device specialized for venipuncture. It is used to access a superficial vein for phlebotomy or IV injections. Unlike a straight needle, a butterfly needle is less painful and is easier to use, because of the winged tubing that allows for greater flexibility, when dealing with difficult veins or those that are hard to see and feel. The size of butterfly needles ranges from 18 to 27 gauge bore. The higher the number, the thinner the needle gets. This is why 21G and 23G are the most common, while 25G and 27G are mostly avoided, because it is believed to clot or hemolyze the blood samples, making them invalid for blood tests. Types of Butterfly Needles Standard safety device ; This type of needle has been the industry standard for many years. Two of its most common sizes are 21G and 23G. A standard safety unit consists of a needle, tubing, and a sheathed needle attached to a hub that will be used in the evacuated tube system.

what are unpaired fins in fish	In some fish, e.g., the eel, a single fin extends from the back, around the tail, and along the ventral surface. In the majority of fishes, however, there are one, two, or three dorsal fins, a distinct tail fin, and an anal fin. These are called median, or unpaired, fins. In addition to these unpaired fins, most fish also have paired fins. The tail is an important organ of locomotion and the paired fins are used for steering, checking speed, balancing, and for slow movements. An adipose fin (fatty tissue without support) is found behind the dorsal fin in some fish, e.g., the salmon and the catfish. See climbing perch; flying fish. Cite this article.Apart from the tail or caudal fin, fins have no direct connection with the spine and are supported by muscles only. Their principal function is to help the fish swim. Fins located in different places on the fish serve different purposes, such as moving forward, turning, keeping an upright position or stopping. Most fish use fins when swimming, flying fish use pectoral fins for gliding, and frogfish use them for crawling. The pelvic fin assists the fish in going up or down through the water, turning sharply, and stopping quickly. 1  In gobies, the pelvic fins are often fused into a single sucker disk. 2  Pelvic fins can take many positions along the ventral surface of the fish.
does weight loss occur overnight	Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity doctor and the author of the new book,  The Overnight Diet , explained the regimen. Users do six days of a high protein diet and one day of a liquid diet. That, combined with sleep, equals weight loss, she claims. You can lose up to two pounds overnight. And then for the six days, you can lose up to nine pounds in one week after the first week, said Apovian, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine and the director of nutrition and weight management at Boston Medical Center. And it takes longer than overnight to do that, he said. Some are skeptical of the diet's claims of so much weight loss so quickly. Apovian acknowledges that the first two pounds lost on her diet are mostly water weight and salt weight, but says it provides the incentive for a high protein diet and more weight loss.Create a Calorie Deficit. Weight loss will occur anytime you consume fewer calories than you burn on a regular basis. One pound of fat is equivalent to 3,500 calories. Therefore, decreasing caloric intake by 500 to 1,000 calories per day should result in approximately one to two pounds of weight loss per week. Weight loss will occur anytime you burn more calories than you consume. There are many weight loss diets on the market promising quick and easy results.

which leukocyte is engaged in adaptive immune system	White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All leukocytes are produced and derived from a multipotent cell in the bone marrow known as a hematopoietic stem cell. Monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic. The number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of disease, and thus the WBC count is an important subset of the complete blood count. The normal white cell count is usually between 4 and 11 × 10 9 /L. In the US this is usually expressed as 4,000–11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. They make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult. An increase in the number of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis, and a decrease below the lower limit is called leukopeniaThe innate immune system is an evolutionarily older defense strategy, and is the dominant immune system found in plants, fungi, insects, and primitive multicellular organisms.

resting heart rate normative data	As an example, a man with a resting heart rate of 72 at an age of 40, will be classed as having an average resting heart rate. A young women at 22 years of age with a resting heart rate of 55, would be classed as (athlete), but not all low resting heart rates are a good indication of an individuals fitness. As you become older, your heart rate decreases, with infants having the highest resting heart rates from 100 to over 160 beats per minute. Young children, under 10, have a resting heart rate range from 70 to 120 beats per minute. Adults generally have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Resting heart rate is an approximate measurement and one of many tools used for testing your health(Note: mm Hg means millimeters of mercury). The resting heart rate for the average person is between 70 and 90 beats per minute (bpm). The term tachycardia is applied to a rapid heart rate (over 100 bpm) and the term bradycardia indicates a slow heart rate (less than 50 bpm). Endurance athletes may have a resting heart rate of less than 50 bpm due to having an enlarged heart as a result of their training regime. An endurance athlete will have a lower resting heart rate and a larger stroke volume than a non-athlete. The cardiac output for an endurance athlete is approx. 35 litres while that for the non-athlete is 22 litres.
what causes twitching muscles in the legs	The common, less serious causes of muscle twitching include: 1  exercise. 2  stress and anxiety. 3  caffeine and other stimulants. 4  nutritional deficiencies. 5  smoking. 6  irritation of the eyelids or surface of your eye. 7  reaction to drugs, such as corticosteroids, stimulants, and estrogen. This condition is fairly common, and symptoms usually go away after a couple of days. There are also less common and more serious causes of muscle twitching. These medical conditions and illnesses are often related to your nervous system. They may damage the nerves connected to your muscles, leading toMuscle twitching, also known as muscle fasciculation, is marked by small muscle contractions in the body. Your muscles are composed of fibers, tissues, and nerves. When a nerve is stimulated or damaged, it may cause your muscle fibers to twitch. Many twitches experienced in your body are common and may go unnoticed. However, other types of twitching may be a sign of a nervous system condition and should be checked out by your doctor. This condition is fairly common, and symptoms usually go away after a couple of days. There are also less common and more serious causes of muscle twitching.

what kind of potting soil for aloe vera plants	Sand and Gravel. All members of the Aloe genus require sandy or gravelly soil with very good drainage to reduce the risk of root rot and nutritional deficiencies. When planted in containers, aloe vera plants do well in a mixture of commercial potting mix with extra sand, granite grit or perlite added. They can also be planted in potting soil meant specifically for cactuses. When planting aloe vera outdoors, look for a sandy spot that dries out completely after rainfall. Use mulch and plastic only with great care around aloes. According to Purdue University, aloe vera plants grown under black polyethylene mulch produced more gel per leaf than plants grown on bare soil, but the appearance and size of the aloes did not change.Soil Recommendations: Here are a few mixtures you can create to give your soil the desert feel an aloe vera prefers: 1. Half Potting Soil, Half Sand: Perhaps the easiest and cheapest solution to your aloe vera soil dilemma is to simply mix your regular potting soil with the same amount of sand. You will want to use river sand, not beach sand. 2. Again, replacing a little bit of regular potting soil with granite grit will help meet your aloe vera plant’s special needs. 3. Equal Parts Potting Soil, Sand, and Perlite: Perlite is a volcanic rock that can expand up to twenty times its normal volume in heat.
What is serigraphy and what is it primarily used for	How Silk Screen Printing Works. While silkscreening is a type of printing, the silk printing press machine used is not quite like the printer you're thinking of. As you might guess, screens are key to the silk screen printing method. Much like an art canvas, the screen or mesh is stretched very tightly over a frame. Traditionally screen printing was done with screens made out of silk (hence the name) but today polyester screens are more common since they often cost less. Once you choose the type of silkscreening press you want to use, do not interchange the type of ink. The result may resemble “jello” in its worst form. As for options within each ink classification, all of these machines usually rely upon Epson inkjet print heads.Serigraphy, also known as silkscreening or screen-printing, is the process of producing an image, or serigraph, by pressing color though a fabric stencil comprised of porous and non-porous sections. The image may be produced onto a fabric, such as a t-shirt, or other material, such as ceramic, paper, or wood. A rubber squeegee is then used to press the ink through the porous areas and onto the paper or fabric below. If the design calls for multiple layers or colors, the ink from the first press is given time to dry, and the process is repeated with a different stencil or different ink color. Ad.
what is a reference range	A cell or cell reference identifies a cell's position on a worksheet. A range or range reference identifies a group of cells and their position on a worksheet. These references tell a Microsoft Excel formula and other Microsoft Excel features where to obtain a value or group of values. What do the Dollar Signs Mean in a Cell Reference or Range Reference. When you place dollar signs around a cell reference or range reference, you are preventing the reference from changing when you copy or paste a cell with a formula in it. Cell references and range references can move relative to your copy and paste, that is what they are designed to do by natureIn health-related fields, a reference range or reference interval is the range of values for a physiologic measurement in healthy persons (for example, the amount of creatinine in the blood, or the partial pressure of oxygen). It is a basis for comparison (a frame of reference) for a physician or other health professional to interpret a set of test results for a particular patient. Some important reference ranges in medicine are reference ranges for blood tests and reference ranges for urine tests. The standard definition of a reference range (usually referred to if not otherwise specified) originates in what is most prevalent in a reference group taken from the general population
how to get started to lose weight	You get started by losing weight and can continue to do so for a very long time by just eating less of what you’re currently eating every day. Most people can eat around 2,000 calories a day and lose weight for a while, but you’ll have to find the number that is specific to you. There are things outside of counting calories that come into play down the road, but counting calories and portion control is the foundation for your weight loss and always will be. You don’t get started losing weight by saying goodbye to ice cream. You lose weight by not eating half a pint in front of the television on a Tuesday night. As far as burning calories, don’t be a gym rat. Unfortunately, you usually see an influx of these guys and gals around early January every year.1 Start an exercise (and food) log. 2  This is where you'll write down what you do every day, how many calories you've burned, how close you are to your goal, and the food choices you've made. 3  If you have a buddy, share it with them for extra responsibility. 4  Start an exercise blog. Not a great way to start off the new you! Keeping your goal realistic makes it attainable -- and when you start reaching your weight loss goals, you become happier. A happier you is much more likely to hit those goals than the you slumped over your keyboard. 1  One pound is 3,500 calories.
what is streamlining in design	An important concept in the study of aerodynamics concerns the idea of streamlines. A streamline is a path traced out by a massless particle as it moves with the flow. It is easiest to visualize a streamline if we move along with the body (as opposed to moving with the flow). The figure above shows the computed streamlines around an airfoil and around a cylinder. In both cases, we move with the object and the flow proceeds from left to right. Since the streamline is traced out by a moving particle, at every point along the path the velocity is tangent to the path. Since there is no normal component of the velocity along the path, mass cannot cross a streamlineThe Normandie Hotel, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was inspired by the ocean liner SS Normandie and displays the ship's original sign. Streamline Moderne, or Art Moderne, is a late type of the Art Deco architecture and design that emerged in the 1930s. Its architectural style emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements. Mossehaus). As the Great Depression of the 1930s progressed, Americans saw a new aspect of Art Deco —i.e., streamlining, a concept first conceived by industrial design ers who stripped Art Deco design of its ornament in favor of the aerodynamic pure-line concept of motion and speed developed from scientific thinking.
The term cerebral dominance designates the hemisphere that is dominant for language	The control of speech and handedness by one hemisphere of the brain. In 90% to 95% of human beings, the left cerebral hemisphere is functionally dominant; as a result most people are right-handed. A lesion (such as a stroke or tumor) to the left cerebral hemisphere of such people will produce aphasia and right-sided paralysis. Aphasia rarely occurs in right-handed people from a right cerebral lesion. In 60% of left-handed people with aphasia from a cerebral lesion, the left side is affected. the specialization of each of the two cerebral hemispheres in the integration and control of different functions. In 90% of the population, the left cerebral hemisphere specializes in or dominates the ability to speak and write and the capacity to understand spoken and written words.The right hemisphere is dominant in early processing of words in Mandarin while the left is dominant in late processing. Studies of American Sign Language have shown more distributed hemispheric activity as opposed to the dominance of the left brain in English speakers. Hemispheric dominance (pseudoscience promoters sometimes call it  brainedness , cf. handedness) refers to the fact that: 1  The two hemispheres of the brain are specialized to perform certain tasks (lateralization). 2  Individuals show a preference toward using one hemisphere in many case
what the difference between crude and brent oil	Brent blend is generally priced at about a $4 per barrel premium compared to the OPEC Basket price and about a $1 to $2 per barrel lower than WTI. For example, on Friday, June 25, 2010, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil closed at $78.86 per barrel while Brent crude was $76.17 a barrel. Light Sweet Crude. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is considered a light sweet crude oil of very high quality and is excellent for refining a larger portion of gasoline. Its API gravity is 39.6 degrees (making it a “light” crude oil), and it contains only about 0.24 percent sulfur (making it a “sweet” crude oil).Location: Brent Blend is a combination of crude oil from 15 different oil fields in the North Sea. It is less “light” and “sweet” than WTI, but still excellent for making gasoline. It is primarily refined in Northwest Europe, and is the major benchmark for other crude oils in Europe or Africa. Brent blend is generally priced at about a $4 per barrel premium to the OPEC Basket price or about a $1-2 per barrel discount to WTI. WTI is also known as Light Sweet Crude, the majority of which is located in the Permian oil Field. The OPEC Basket Price is an average of the prices of oil from Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Venezuela, and Mexico. OPEC uses the price of this basket to monitor world oil market conditions
another term for antigens	The invading microbe or pathogen is called an antigen. It is regarded as a threat by the immune system and is capable of stimulating an immune response. Antigens are proteins that are found on the surface of the pathogen. Antigens are unique to that pathogen. The whooping cough bacterium, for example, will have different antigens on its surface from the TB bacterium. When an antigen enters the body, the immune system produces antibodies against it. A type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte recognizes the antigen as being foreign and produces antibodies that are specific to that antigen. Each antibody has a unique binding site shape which locks onto the specific shape of the antigen.Full Definition of ANTIGEN. : any substance (as an immunogen or a hapten) foreign to the body that evokes an immune response either alone or after forming a complex with a larger molecule (as a protein) and that is capable of binding with a product (as an antibody or T cell) of the immune response. — an·ti·gen·ic \ˌan-ti-ˈje-nik\ adjective.

what does the forebrain control	10 most extreme places on Earth. The forebrain is the largest section of the brain in humans and most animals. As its name suggests, it sits in the most forward position of any brain section, and is normally separated into two hemispheres known as the diencephalon and the telencephalon. In terms of shape, the forebrain looks sort of like a semi-circle or cup turned on its side, and it’s usually quite large. In adults it can take up about half of the total brain space. A lot is going on in the tissues here, and it’s often easiest to identify the exact functions by taking things one hemisphere at a time.At the five-vesicle stage, the forebrain separates into the diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus, epithalamus, and pretectum) and the telencephalon which develops into the cerebrum. The cerebrum consists of the cerebral cortex, underlying white matter, and the basal ganglia. (Redirected from Prosencephalon). In the anatomy of the brain of vertebrates, the forebrain or prosencephalon is the rostral-most (forward-most) portion of the brain. The forebrain, the midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon) are the three primary portions of the brain during early development of the central nervous system. It controls body temperature, reproductive functions, eating, sleeping, and any display of emotions
what cause stomach to be hard and gain weight	If so, you are not alone.Difficult weight gain in the stomach, belly, waist, hips and thighs can be nearly impossible to lose unless you can properly identify the underlying factor(s) that is causing the weight gain. This isn't always easy because there are so many potential causes of weight gain. For some, the cause of weight gain could simply be lack of exercise or excess calories in the diet. But those are the easy cases to solve. A simple diet and exercise log is all I need to correct a poor diet or improper exercise. But for you, the cause of weight gain could be something hidden deep in your metabolism-something that is preventing you from losing weight no matter how hard you try. And often, the harder you try, the more weight you gain1 These symptoms are common and are usually not a matter of concern. 2  Constipation: Constipation is a condition when one does not pass stools regularly or has difficulty in passing stools due to their hard nature. 3  Pain in stomach, bloating, nausea, weight gain, cramps, etc., are the symptoms of constipation. It causes a lot of discomfort and also makes the person irritable. It is a common symptom of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, etc. However, bloated stomach and weight gain, together, is a rare symptom observed only in case of certain health conditions.

what does an egyptian scarab mean	Scarab Meaning ~. Scarab beetle is a guide of the cosmic universe, teaching us about the elements of the creative forces... For the Scarab is symbolic of eternity itself. The mystical Scarab beetle appears now to show you a crossroads... you have the choice of continuing on the same path you have taken thus far, or you can peer down the path that holds a new awakening and enlightenment of the cosmic elements and forces.Beetles of the Scarabaeidae family (dung beetle) roll dung into a ball as food and as a brood chamber in which to lay eggs that are later transformed into larvae. For these reasons the scarab was seen as a symbol of this heavenly cycle and of the idea of rebirth or regeneration. The Egyptian god Khepri, Ra as the rising sun, was often depicted as a scarab beetle or as a scarab beetle-headed man. The ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. For reasons that are not clear (although no doubt connected to the religious significance of the Egyptian god Khepri), amulets in the form of scarab beetles had become enormously popular in Ancient Egypt by the early Middle Kingdom (approx. 2000 BCE) and remained popular for the rest of the pharaonic period and beyond.
what causes brown stains o	Iron cleaner works well on brown iron and rust stains. You can also clean brown iron stains with iron cleaner, available in many stores, including big-box home stores. Iron cleaner is a white powder that is made of sodium hydrosulphite and/or metabisulfite. Both can be tough to clean. Do Not Throw Away Those Iron Stained Clothes! Your rust stained clothes, fixtures, sidewalks, driveways, and walls are not a lost cause. Here are a few ways to clean your hard water and iron stains. Vinegar and elbow grease can clean hard water stains.Colloidal iron may be present in shallow wells or surface water supplies. It is seldom found in deep well supplies. Like other forms of iron, colloidal iron causes reddish-brown stains on laundry, plumbing fixtures, and cooking utensils. When iron water is used in tea, coffee or whisky, the beverage turns unappetizingly black. Iron water has an unpleasant metallic taste. Water containing oxidized iron is filled with reddish rust particles visible in the water when first drawn from the tap. This is commonly referred to as red water iron. Red water iron causes the same problems which are caused by clear water iron. Reddish-brown stains on clothes, porcelain, and cooking utensils. When iron water is mixed with tea, coffee or alcoholic beverages, the mixture commonly referred to as red water iron
gmo definition food good or bad	GMOs are bad for your body, bad for the community, bad for farmers and bad for the environment. This is why: 1  The health consequences of eating genetically modified organisms are largely unknown. 2  Genetically engineered foods have not been shown to be safe to eat and may have unpredictable consequences. This is why: 1  The health consequences of eating genetically modified organisms are largely unknown. 2  Food items that contain GMOs are unlabeled in America. 3  Genetic engineering reduces genetic diversity. 4  Once the mutant genes are out of the bag, there is no going back. 5  GMOs are not the answer for global food security. 6  Genetically engineered foods ...Modifying the genetic structure of food is not a new concept. For centuries, farmers have improved our food supply by cross-breeding different types of plants or animals to come up with new organisms that would taste better, yield more, and grow in more difficult conditions. Not to mention, they also had a very small control group (fed non-GMO food) of 20 rats that also developed tumors. Despite the results of the contested study, more research needs to be done on the long-term effects of genetically modified foods on humans. Until that happens, many European countries, like Russia and the UK, have already banned certain types of GMOs for human consumption
how long does it take to get a mortgage license	Usually most companies are able to provide the needed documentation within 2 to 4 weeks. And the states take 8 to 12 weeks to process the application. So the average time to obtain a mortgage license from start to finish is between 10 to 16 weeks. But remember, you need to make sure the application is complete and to provide the needed documentation right away or it could easily turn in to a 9 to 12 month process. 04.13.2009. 10:07. Again, a process that should take a couple months turns into 4 or 5 months very easily. Another very important aspect of how long it will take to get a mortgage license is the time to prepare the application.

what are antioxidants	As the name implies, antioxidants are substances that are capable of counteracting the damaging, but normal, effects of the physiological process of oxidation in animal tissue. Antioxidants are nutrients (vitamins and minerals) as well as enzymes (proteins in your body that assist in chemical reactions). They are believed to play a role in preventing the development of such chronic diseases as cancer, heart disease ,stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and cataracts. It is impossible for us to avoid damage by free radicals. Free radicals arise from sources both inside (endogenous) and outside (exogenous) our bodies. Oxidants that develop from processes within our bodies form as a result of normal aerobic respiration, metabolism, and inflammation.Oxidative stress occurs when the production of harmful molecules called free radicals is beyond the protective capability of the antioxidant defenses. Free radicals are chemically active atoms or molecular fragments that have a charge due to an excess or deficient number of electrons. It is impossible for us to avoid damage by free radicals. Free radicals arise from sources both inside (endogenous) and outside (exogenous) our bodies. Oxidants that develop from processes within our bodies form as a result of normal aerobic respiration, metabolism, and inflammation.
wat is cappuccino koffie	315 pages on this wiki. A cappuccino with an apple drawn with the foam. A cappuccino is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and milk. It consists of one-third espresso, one-third third heated milk and one-third milk foam and is generally served in a 6 to 8-ounce cup.The cappuccino is considered one of the original espresso drinks representative of Italian espresso cuisine and eventually Italian-American espresso cuisine.talian Edit. The original Italian cappuccino consists of a single shot (1.26ounces) of espresso topped with a small amount of milk and froth. The milk is not heavily frothed, but is a thicker foam that becomes a part of the espresso rather than a layer on top of the coffee.A cappuccino (/ˌkaepʉˈtʃiːnoʊ/ ; [ˌkæpʉˈtʃiːnoʊ]) kapputˈtʃiːno is An italian coffee drink which is traditionally prepared with, espresso hot milk and steamed milk.

what temperature to cook steak on gas grill	1 Once grill is preheated clean the grill with a grill brush to remove residue. 2  Add some oil to a paper towel and using tongs oil the hot grill by rubbing paper towel and oil across the bars of the grill. ( 3 This helps prevent the meat from sticking to the metal grill bars.). 4  Place ribeye steaks on freshly oiled grill. 1 Place ribeye steaks on freshly oiled grill. 2  Cooked uncovered for approximately 8 minutes. 3  Flip the steak when the first side is looking done (aprox 8 minutes) and cook for another five minutes or so. 4  To test remove a steak from direct heat and insert a meat thermometer into the middle of the steak.Medium. To prepare a medium steak on the grill, cook to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. When you press the steak, it should feel slightly firm with a pink center and a grayish burn on the outside. As a general rule, cook a 1-inch steak to medium by leaving it on the grill for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Well Done. A well-done steak needs an internal temperature of 170 degrees Fahrenheit. To reach this internal temperature, you need to leave the steak on the grill for 4 to 5 minutes per side for a 1-inch steak or 8 to 9 minutes for a steak measuring 1 3/4 inches. Leave the steak on the grill for an extended period of time, only flipping the steak once after 5 minutes of grilling
how to get periods first time immediately naturally	The menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. A normal menstrual cycle can be as short as 21 days or longer than 35 days. For most women, it lasts 25 - 30 days. But it's common for your cycle to vary from month to month. Here are the basics: 1  You have two ovaries. There's no way to know exactly when you'll get your first period. One day, you'll begin to bleed from your vagina, and that's your period. It means that your body is healthy and normal. Most girls have their first period when they're between 9 and 15 years old. Your period may start around the time it started for other people in your family, like your mom or sisters. If you don't get your period by the time you're 15, you may want to talk with a doctor or nurseTo see what happens on each day of your menstrual cycle check out our cool guide to your period. Keep in mind that your periods may not be regular at first. You may have two in one month, or have a month without a period at all. Periods will become more regular in time. Natural body chemicals, or hormones, cause your ovaries to release one egg about once a month. Most months, the egg and the lining of your uterus come out of your vagina as your period. This is part of your menstrual cycle. This cycle is what makes it possible for a woman to have a baby.
what is meander in geography	A meander, in general, is a bend in a sinuous watercourse or river. A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a meandering course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a snaking pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridgesMeanders. Meanders occur in the middle valley and are the result of erosion AND deposition processes on a river. In this section of the valley the river erodes laterally and migrates across the valley floor over time, widening the valley. Flood plains, Levees and Yazoo streams. Rivers flood on a regular basis. The area over which they flood is known as the floodplain and this often coincides with regions where meanders form. When rivers flood in the middle valley the cover an area of land known as the flood plain. When they flood velocity is slowed and deposition of any rocks being transported is encouraged
how to type backslash on US keyboard	Zacy5000 said: Or you could use 'Alt Gr + The normal US button for backslash'. Alt Gr is the one to the right hand side of the space bar and the normal US button for the backslash is next to the enter button and shift key (may slightly differ on different keyboards). This is much easier then using the Alt code. This is more for my own reference than anything else but today I was needing to enter a backslash key while using a US keyboard but with UK keyboard settings. After trying pretty much every key on the keyboard in all combinations, I realised there was no key combination that would do this directly.Answer: The backslash key is located near the Enter or Return key on most keyboards. It is most often found directly to the left of the Enter key, but can also be placed below or above the enter key. The backslash key is located directly above the the Return key on Apple keyboards. It is important to differentiate between the backslash and the forward slash keys. The backslash key has a pipe character above it, which is a straight vertical line. The forward slash key has a question mark above it. Forward slashes are used to designate directories in URLs, i.e. http://www.sharpened.net/helpcenter/ , while backslashes are used do designate Windows directories, like you may see in Windows Explorer, i.e. C:\Program Files\ .

how many obese in australia	A 2005 WHO study found that just over 20% of Australian adults are obese, which is expected to rise to roughly 29% in 2010 if current trends continue. In the 2005 National Health Survey, 53.6% of Australians reported being overweight (above a 25 BMI), with 18% falling into the obese category (above a 30 BMI). In 2005, a study was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that compared the results of a 2004-05 survey with those conducted in the preceding 15 years. The results showed an increase in the number and proportion of adults who are overweight or obese.Yet still half of adults (54%) in the wealthiest urban areas were overweight or obese, and two in 10 (19%) were obese.Overweight and obesity rates are increasing rapidly across Australia. In 1989, 44% of adults were overweight or obese, rising to 63% in 2011–12. 1,2 Health problems related to excess body weight impact the health care system, as well as individuals, families and the community.Obesity imposed an estimated $2 billion in direct costs on Australia’s health system in 2008. In 2011–12, 10.8 million adults were either overweight or obese, and of these 4.7 million were obese.* This report shows that the percentage of adults who were obese varied three-fold across local areas, from 14% in Sydney North Shore and Beaches to 41% in Loddon-Mallee-Murray.
how does age affect your hearing	As you age and get older, your hearing will get worse. It is a fact that as a human ages, all of the organs will slowly begin to shut down.he most common form of hearing loss associated with aging results from degeneration of a part of the inner ear which contains microscopic blood vessels. This type of hearin … g loss does not disproportionately affect the individual's ability to hear and understand speech.About one-third of Americans between the ages of 65 and 74 have hearing problems. About half the people who are 85 and older have hearing loss. Whether a hearing loss is small (missing certain sounds) or large (being profoundly deaf), it is a serious concern.If left untreated, problems can get worse.Hearing loss can affect your life in many ways. You may miss out on talks with friends and family.On the telephone, you may find it hard to hear what the caller is saying. At the doctor's office, you may not catch the doctor's words. Sometimes hearing problems can make you feel embarrassed, upset, and lonely.t's also easy for friends and family to think you are confused, uncaring, or difficult, when the problem may be that you just can't hear well. If you have trouble hearing, there is help. Start by seeing your doctor. Depending on the type and extent of your hearing loss, there are many treatment choices that may help.
is tungsten a metal	Pure tungsten is a light gray or whitish metal that is soft enough to be cut with a hacksaw and ductile enough to be drawn into wire or extruded into various shapes. If contaminated with other materials, tungsten becomes brittle and difficult to work with.Tungsten has the highest melting point of all metallic elements and is used to make filaments for incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs and television tubes.Tungsten expands at nearly the same rate as borosilicate glass and is used to make metal to glass seals.ure tungsten is a light gray or whitish metal that is soft enough to be cut with a hacksaw and ductile enough to be drawn into wire or extruded into various shapes. If contaminated with other materials, tungsten becomes brittle and difficult to work with.Tungsten (W) is a metal with a wide range of uses, the largest of which is as tungsten carbide in cemented carbides.Cemented carbides (also called hardmetals) are wear-resistant materials used by the metalworking, mining, and construction industries.ungsten is also used to make heavy metal alloys for armaments, heat sinks, and high-density applications, such as weights and counterweights; superalloys for turbine blades; tool steels; and wear-resistant alloy parts and coatings. Tungsten composites are used as a substitute for lead in bullets and shot.
does a tax lien expire	From the lien itself, we now have the date the IRS collection statute should expire. As stated on the face of the lien, the lien itself operates as a certificate of release after the collection statute expires. Column (e) gives you that date, which is 30 days after the IRS collection statute expired. Understanding Federal tax liens: How they work, when they expire and why they can be refiled. by Howard S. Levy, Esq. on. in IRS collection notices, Tax liens. The Internal Revenue Code does not make it easy to understand how Federal tax liens work. Hopefully, that is what I am here for. The starting point to understanding your tax lien is to know that it lasts for the amount of time the IRS has to collect from you – 10 yearsin Statute of limitations on collections, Tax liens. IRS tax liens are not forever. They do expire – here is an overview of when: For starters, the IRS has 10 years to pursue you for the unpaid taxes that caused the lien to be filed. The 10 years starts on the date you began owing the IRS money. After the 10 year collection timeframe expires, so does the IRS tax lien. The tax lien will still expire at the end of 10 years – even if the IRS has more than 10 years to collect – unless the IRS timely refiles the lien. If the IRS timely refiles the tax lien, it is treated as continuation of the initial lien.
why is it that below a certain depth planktonic organisms leave behind	Plankton can be divided into two large groups: planktonic plants and planktonic animals. The plant plankton or phytoplankton are the producers of ocean and freshwater food chains. They are autotrophs, making their own food, using the process of photosynthesis. The animal plankton or zooplankton eat food for energy. These heterotrophs feed on the microscopic world of the sea and transfer energy up the food pyramid to fishes, marine mammals, and humans. Unit Six SSWIMS/Plankton Project Oceanography Fall 2001 107 Zooplankton Planktonic animals are called zooplankton. Unlike phytoplankton, which must have sunlight to live, zooplankton can live at all depths of the ocean. Zooplankton are either holoplankton (permanent plankton) or meroplankton (temporary plankton). Holoplankton live up in the water all of their livePhytoplankton drifting about below the surface of the water still carry out photosynthesis. This process can occur as long as enough light is available for the chlorophyll and other pigments to absorb. In the ocean, light can reach as far as 200m below the surface 25. Chlorophyll is not the only photosynthetic pigment found in algae and phytoplankton. There are also carotenoids,and phycobilins (biliproteins). These accessory pigments are responsible for other organism colors, such as yellow, red, blue and brown.

how is earth moving in space	For those of us living at Earth's midlatitudes -- including the United States, Europe, and Japan -- the rate is almost a thousand miles an hour. The rate is higher at the equator and lower at the poles. In addition to this daily rotation, Earth orbits the Sun at an average speed of 67,000 mph, or 18.5 miles a second. Perhaps that seems a bit sluggish -- after all, Mars Pathfinder journeyed to Mars at nearly 75,000 miles per hour. The Milky Way itself is moving through the vastness of intergalactic space. Our galaxy belongs to a cluster of nearby galaxies, the Local Group, and together we are easing toward the center of our cluster at a leisurely 2Of course, there's more motions than Earth's daily “spin” on its axis to consider.Besides rotating on its axis, the Earth is moving around the Sun, the whole Solar System is moving around the Galaxy and the Galaxy is moving through space! We know the Earth is moving in nearly circular orbit around the Sun. We are moving along in this orbit at almost 30 kilometers per second, or just over 67,000 miles per hour. Our planet is a slightly flattened sphere with a circumference of 40,075 km at the equator. This means that at the equator, the Earth is spinning with a speed of 460 m/s, about 1,070 mph. This speed decreases as you move to higher latitudes because the circle is smaller.
what is urinalysis specific gravity	A routine urinalysis usually includes a test for urine specific gravity. Learn what it is and why it is an important part of lab test screening. slide 1 of 4. One of the important functions of the kidneys is to remove metabolic waste from the body while maintaining the composition and volume of fluids in the body.he concentration of the particles in the urine is measured by the test for urine specific gravity. It may also be called urine density and more specifically, urine osmolality, which is expressed in particles/kg water.Specific gravity measures the kidney's ability to concentrate or dilute urine in relation to plasma. Because urine is a solution of minerals, salts, and compounds dissolved in water, the specific gravity is greater than 1.000.The more concentrated the urine, the higher the urine specific gravity.An adult's kidneys have a remarkable ability to concentrate or dilute urine. In infants, the range for specific gravity is less because immature kidneys are not able to concentrate urine as effectively as mature kidneys.he more concentrated the urine, the higher the urine specific gravity. An adult's kidneys have a remarkable ability to concentrate or dilute urine. In infants, the range for specific gravity is less because immature kidneys are not able to concentrate urine as effectively as mature kidneys.
can you break dogs chasing cars	While you undergo changing your dog’s car chasing behavior, you should consider an invisible fence to help reinforce the idea that while outside, your dog needs to stay in your yard. If you have a tree in the front yard or something else sturdy, you can also tie your dog up with enough slack to enjoy exploring the yard.Make sure you use a strong enough rope or material to keep your dog in place, even when temptations arise.raining.

Once your dog masters this skill he should always fall back and come to you based on your voice command.Attention and Exercise. Sometimes dogs are more inclined to chase cars because they have pent-up energy and they have a natural desire to chase. By giving your dog extra attention and plenty of exercise, you can help curb this extra need to chase something.Even better, incorporate chase in play time!raining. While the above steps can be taken immediately, it is important to also teach your dog to stop chasing when you do not want him to. The best way to do this is to hone in on the command “come..

wat is known as resonance	The intensity is defined as the square of the amplitude of the oscillations. This is a Lorentzian function, and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. γ is a parameter dependent on the damping of the oscillator, and is known as the linewidth of the resonance.Heavily damped oscillators tend to have broad linewidths, and respond to a wider range of driving frequencies around the resonant frequency.he intensity is defined as the square of the amplitude of the oscillations. This is a Lorentzian function, and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. γ is a parameter dependent on the damping of the oscillator, and is known as the linewidth of the resonance.Frequencies at which the response amplitude is a relative maximum are known as the system's resonant frequencies, or resonance frequencies.At resonant frequencies, small periodic driving forces have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations. This is because the system stores vibrational energy.he intensity is defined as the square of the amplitude of the oscillations. This is a Lorentzian function, and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. γ is a parameter dependent on the damping of the oscillator, and is known as the linewidth of the resonance.
what orchids are endangered	Orchid smuggling is one part of the epidemic of plant and wildlife smuggling, with an illegal commercial trade totaling $5 billion in 1994 (Schevitz, p. C2). Besides orchids, other plants that are illegally traded include threatened or endangered cacti and carnivorous plants. (see PLANT case). In the past, authorities in the West have usually turned a blind eye to plant smuggling because they had more serious issues to deal with. However, the majority of orchids grow in warm climates. In the United States, orchids are most likely to be found in Hawaii and Florida. Most internationally traded orchids come from the tropical nations of Asia or South America, such as India, Thailand, China, Singapore, Madagascar, Brazil, and Guatemala.The three orchids in the study. A) Downy rattlesnake orchid, endangered in Florida; B) Cranefly orchid, endangered in Massachusetts and New York; C) Lily-leaved twayblade, endangered in Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island. (Melissa McCormick/SERC). Meanwhile, the fungi displayed a strong preference for older forests. All this implies that to save endangered orchids, it’s not a simple matter of planting new forests to replace the ones that were destroyed. If the forests aren’t old enough or don’t have enough of the right fungi, lost orchids may take decades to return, if they return at all.
what is it called the site of dna is unzipped	The structure of DNA lends itself easily to DNA replication. Each side of the double helix runs in opposite (anti-parallel) directions. The beauty of this structure is that it can unzip down the middle and each side can serve as a pattern or template for the other side (called semi-conservative replication). However, DNA does not unzip entirely. It unzips in a small area called a replication fork, which then moves down the entire length of the molecule. Let's look at the details: 1  An enzyme called DNA gyrase makes a nick in the double helix and each side separates. 2  An enzyme called helicase unwinds the double-stranded DNA. DNA Replication. ­DNA carries the information for making all of the cell's proteins. These pro­teins implement all of the functions of a living organism and determine the organism'­s characteristics. When the cell reproduces, it has to pass all of this information on to the daughter cells.DNA Molecule: DNA Unzip. Transcript: The DNA double helix contains two sequences of nucleotide code letters than run along the molecule. Untwist the spiral and DNA can be seen as two parallel strands. That's why its sometimes called the double helix. Unzip the strands and you have two linear sequences of the letters A C G and T. The precise order of the letters along the molecule carries the coded instructions
how does healthy habits maintain healthy weight	Studies have shown that between 80 to 95 percent of dieters regain lost weight, often gaining more than when they started (Tremblay, 2013). The key to maintaining your weight is adopting healthy lifestyle habits that are repeated day in and day out. Keeping extra weight off requires effort and commitment, through changes in eating habits, exercise and state of mind. These five tips will help you maintain, and keep pursuing new challenges to improve your health and fitness. Tip #5: Stay Active, Stay Accountable. Finally, if you want to maintain your weight loss, you must stay active and accountable for continuing to live a healthy lifestyle. Just because you have achieved your goal does not mean you should regress back to old habits.Ways to Keep Kids at a Healthy Weight. If your child is at a healthy weight now, you may wonder what you can do to help him maintain it. If your child is currently overweight, you may wonder how you can help her adopt a healthier lifestyle. Well, according to experts, rigorous diets and exercise plans are not the healthy habits to be striving for. Healthy Habit 1: Choose to eat dinner as a family. You can encourage family health by having the whole family sit down to dinner together as often as possible. It might seem like an odd way to help with your child's weight, but experts say it can.
what time was the treaty of paris signed	The Treaty had been signed by delegates from the Unites States and Great Britain, as well as France and Spain, in Paris on September 3, 1783. Congress assent was required for the Treaty to take effect, and delegates were called to convene at Annapolis, then serving as the nation's capital, in November, 1783. Ratification of the Treaty of Paris. On January 14, 1784, the Treaty of Paris was ratified by the Congress of the United States, while they met in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House.

hpv vaccine age limit for men	All kids who are 11 or 12 years old should get the three-dose series of HPV vaccine to protect against HPV. Teen boys and girls who did not start or finish the HPV vaccine series when they were younger should get it now. Young women can get HPV vaccine through age 26, and young men can get vaccinated through age 21. The vaccine is also recommended for any man who has sex with men through age 26, and for men with compromised immune systems (including HIV) through age 26, if they did not get HPV vaccine when they were younger. Read more: HPV Vaccine-Questions & Answers. Top of Page. The HPV vaccine is recommended for preteen boys and girls at age 11 or 12 so they are protected before ever being exposed to the virus. HPV vaccine also produces a more robust immune response during the preteen years. Finally, older teens are less likely to get heath check-ups than preteens.Gardasil ® is approved for use in females and males aged 9-26. (In April 2011, Gardasil ® was approved for use in women up to the age of 45 years.). The vaccine requires 3 doses to be given over the course of 6 months (0, 2 and 6 months). In April 2011, Gardasil ® was approved for use in women up to the age of 45 years. Cervarix™ provides protection against the two HPV types that cause approximately 70 per cent of all cervical cancers (HPV-16 and HPV-18).
what kind of benefits do ultrasound techs get	Again that is the benefit of being a Sonographer and choosing the schedule that fits your personal lifestyle. Short School Requirements. Another crucial benefit of becoming a Sonographer is the amount of schooling in comparison to the overall rewarding career of Ultrasound. On average it does take four years to complete your degree in ultrasound. There are about 2 years of prerequisites and the actual program that you must apply for and be accepted into is a 2 year program, at most schools. The programs consist of 1 year in class work and 1 year in a clinical site working as an intern. The great benefit to Ultrasound is many doctors are requesting ultrasound first because they are fast, no radiation, and low cost to the patient. Ultrasound Job Work Schedules. Ultrasound, just like any radiology modality can have flexible schedules.Sometimes, however, doctors and technicians can get a better diagnostic image by inserting a special transducer into one of the body's natural openings: 1  In a transvaginal ultrasound, a transducer wand is placed in a woman’s vagina to get better images of her uterus and ovaries. 1 In a transvaginal ultrasound, a transducer wand is placed in a woman’s vagina to get better images of her uterus and ovaries. 2  A transrectal ultrasound is sometimes used in the diagnosis of prostate conditions.
what is wry neck	Chronic wry neck can cause debilitating pain and difficulty performing daily tasks. Fortunately, medications and therapies can help to relieve pain and stiffness. Surgery can also sometimes correct the condition. Treatment is most successful when begun early, especially for children. Congenital forms of wry neck can be improved by stretching the neck muscle. If started within a few months of birth, this treatment can be very successful. If this or other treatments don’t work, surgery can sometimes correct the problem. Acquired wry neck is treated according to the cause, if known.Wry neck is a complaint where you develop neck pain and stiffness, which is often accompanied by spasm of the surrounding neck muscles. This causes neck pain and an inability to turn your neck through its full range of motion. Wry neck can also be referred to as acute wry neck since the onset is sudden-or acute! Wry neck is an extremely common condition, which can be quite disabling as the sufferer experiences constant severe pain with simple neck movements. The most common cause of acute wry neck is a locked facet joint. Facet joints are located at the back of your spinal column. These facet joints allow, guide and limit the movements of your neck. Your facet joints are intended to allow smooth gliding movements between the adjacent vertebra.
what is chemical energy in the body	The dry wood is a store of chemical energy. As it burns in the fireplace, chemical energy is released and converted to thermal energy (heat) and light energy. Notice that the wood now turns into ashes (a new substance). Food is also a good example of stored chemical energy. This energy is released during digestion. Molecules in our food are broken down into smaller pieces. As the bonds between these atoms loosen or break, a chemical reaction will occur, and new compounds are created. RECOMMENDED LESSONS: Chemical energy. Chemical Energy is energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds (atoms and molecules). It is released in a chemical reaction, often producing heat as a by product (exothermic reaction) . Batteries, biomass, petroleum, natural gas, and coal are examples of stored chemical energy.Chemical energy. Chemical Energy is energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds (atoms and molecules).

what types of injuries usually result from overusing	Overuse injuries also happen in people who are returning to a sport or activity after injury and try to make up for lost time by pushing themselves to achieve the level of participation they were at before injury. Proper technique is critical in avoiding overuse injuries, as slight changes in form may be the culprit. Some tips for treating an overuse injury include: 1  Cutting back the intensity, duration, and frequency of an activity. 2  Adopting a hard/easy workout schedule and crosstraining with other activities to maintain fitness levels. 3  Learning about proper training and technique from a coach or athletic trainer.Five Most Common Overuse Injuries in Runners. An overuse injury is an injury that does not result from a single incident of trauma but is instead caused by repeated stress to an area. Runners are typically vulnerable since running cause a large amount of shock through the legs in a repeated fashion. Achilles tendinitis. The Achilles tendon is located on the back of the ankle and attaches the muscles of the calf to the heel bone. This type of injury is usually precipitated by overuse and can be slow to heal as the tendon does not receive much blood flow. Achilles tendinitis is common in runners. Patellofemoral pain (Runners Knee). Runner’s knee is the most diagnosed condition in sports medicine clinic

pyrite is called fools gold because it looks a lot like gold. which properties can be used to tell gold and pyrite apart	You can try to scratch it because pyrite or fools gold much harder then gold so if it doesn't scratch that much it is most likely pyrite or fools gold. You can tell them apart by looking at their reflection and streak. Also, gold is much more dense than pyrite, so the same volume would 'weigh' about 3.5 times more. Gold has a hardness of about 2.5, while pyrite is about 6 (Gold is softer and more malable). Streak is used to distinguish between Gold and Pyrite. Pyrite also known as fool's gold is a mineral that has both a different chemical, morphological and physical characteristics than gold. Gold is denser (i.e. the same size of gold is much heavier than the that of pyrite). Gold's average density is 17.64 g/cm3 while Pyrite's density is on average 5.01 g/cm3.· just now. 1  Pyrite is an iron sulphide, and a common ore for both iron and for the manufacture of sulphur compounds. 2  The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, is iron disulfide, FeS2. 3  Pyrite is fools gold. 4  It's a metal. 5  omg we just learned about this earlier this week! 6  The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, is iron disulfide, FeS2. It has isometric crystals that usually appear as cubes.

how long for bluegrass to germinate	Bluegrass seeds do take longer to germinate (often 4-8 weeks), thus many landscapers also include perennial ryegrass as part of their turf establishment. Visit our informational site www.lawngrasses.com for more about seeding rates and lawn choices for grasses. For bluegrass pasture seeding the rate is normally lower. Planting Bluegrass Seed & NOT TILLING. You are not tilling the soil-and are planting seeds within the existing grass & weeds; OVERSEEDING-Note: Bluegrass may have thin spots over time, so overseeding helps to thicken the turf in those areas to achieve higher plant density.Unlike perennial ryegrass and Kentucky bluegrass, Zoysia is a warm-season grass, meaning it germinates best when the temperatures are in the 70s or 80s. Typically germination time for Zoysiagrass seed is 10 days or more, so if you're not seeing growth by the time you hit the two-week mark, it's time to start worrying. Different lawn varieties will germinate at different times. Know how long your grass seeds should take, and the waiting will be much easier. Yes No. Your not-yet-growing-grass may be right on track!

who was frank sutcliffe	Francis Meadow (Frank) Sutcliffe (6 October 1853 – 31 May 1941) was an English pioneering photographic artist whose work presented an enduring record of life in the seaside town of Whitby, England, and surrounding areas, in the late Victorian era and early 20th century. Contents. His most famous photograph was taken in 1886; Water Rats caused a little comment at the time as it featured naked children playing in a boat, but the image is not erotic. Sutcliffe was using the conventions of the academic nude to show how photography can approach art. He was, however, excommunicated by his local clergy for displaying it, as they thought it would 'corrupt' the opposite sex. Edward VII (then the Prince of Wales) later purchased a copy of the pictureThe early building was destroyed by Vikings and was refounded in 1077. 2000 saw the 460th anniversary of the Abbey's dissolution.

what are the peacocks predators	Often brightly colored with large, fan-like tails that can span 60 inches, peacocks are the male members of a species of bird in the same family as the pheasants native to North America. Peacocks are often kept as pets or farmed for their beautiful tail feathers, which have made them a national symbol in India. The green peafowl is native to Burma and Java, while the blue comes from India and Sri Lanka. These countries are home to a wide range of large hunters, and peacocks have fallen prey to the likes of large jungle cats such as leopards and tigers, but also to smaller animals, like the mongoose or stray dogs.Male peacocks are known as peacocks and female peacocks are known as peahens (in a similar way to chickens and pheasants). The male is peacock is generally about twice the size of the female peahen, and even larger when the male peacock is displaying his plumage (feathers). When the male peacock does not have his brightly coloured and very elaborate tail feathers on display, they drag behind him. This is known as a tail or a train. During the mating season, the male peacock may mate with up to six different female peahens. The female peahen lays between 4 and 8 brown coloured eggs. The female peahen incubates her eggs by sitting on them, and the peacock chicks hatch after an incubation period of about a month
governmental accounting definition	DEFINITION of 'Government Accounting Standards Board-GASB'. An organization whose main purpose is to improve and create accounting reporting standards or generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These standards make it easier for users to understand and use the financial records of both state and local governments. BREAKING DOWN 'Government Accounting Standards Board-GASB'. While the state and local governments follow the standards created by the GASB, the federal government reports according to the standards set by the Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB).Governmental accounting is an umbrella term which refers to the various accounting systems used by various public sector entities. In the United States, for instance, there are two levels of government which follow different accounting standards set forth by independent, private sector boards. At the federal level, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) sets forth the accounting standards to follow. Similarly, there is the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) for state and local level government. The governmental accounting system has a different focus for measuring accounting than private sector accounting. Rather than measuring the flow of economic resources, governmental accounting measures the flow of financial resources.
organs affected by cardiovascular disease	The image shows how smoking can affect arteries in the heart and legs. Figure A shows the location of coronary heart disease and peripheral arterial disease. Figure B shows a detailed view of a leg artery with atherosclerosis—plaque buildup that's partially blocking blood flow. They also can damage the function of your heart and the structure and function of your blood vessels. This damage increases your risk of atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). Atherosclerosis is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up in the arteries.Heart disease is a general term to describe any cardiovascular disease that affects the heart and/or the blood vessels in the heart. The following conditions are considered heart disease: Coronary artery disease: This disease affects the arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood. If these arteries become blocked and the flow of blood is restricted to the heart, a heart attack may occur. Coronary artery disease can also lead to other problems such as chest pain (angina). When this happens, there is a risk for coronary artery disease. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the two leading causes of kidney disease.

what can lizards do	There are many types of lizards and they range in size from very small geckos to large kimono dragons. For the purposes of this article, we will focus on the types of lizards that are commonly kept as household pets. There are many types of lizards that can be kept as pets; they make friendly and long-lived companions. Lizards eat a variety of foods depending on the species, so knowing which species of lizard you have is a vital first step when trying to provide proper nutrition. Most of the commonly kept pet lizards are insectivores and can be kept alive on insects, but fruits, plants and small animals are also great options for some lizards. For example, a good diet for a bearded dragon might include leafy greens as well as crickets, and even frozen mice.Some lizards can grow a new tail. Food: Some lizards eat bugs and spiders. Others eat plants, small animals, or even other lizards. Most lizards use their eyes to look for food. Some use their sense of smell. Lizards have jaws with teeth. They also have teeth on the roof of their mouth. I'm thinking of catching another gecko lizard and put it in with the other gecko lizard and see what they do together. That will be good now. I think that I can learn about lizards a lot easier in the rain forest than in a book because you can see what they do and see where they go.

salary for exploration manager australia	By comparison the salaries for geologist seem puny: a junior geologist is earning an average of $39,300, a project geologist $56,100, and a senior geologist $84,700. The exploration manager is doing relatively well at $118,500. If you are an exploration manager in the US you could get $126,400, and you could do even better in Europe at $157,900. Certainly as a young geologist you can harbor expectations of salary increases. This is most definitely a difference between the expat salaries and the Chinese nationals as detailed in the summary sheets. Another example: the technician in Namibia gets a mere $1,200 a year compared to the exploration manager’s $96,400. Again a glaring difference in salaries between expats and nationals.Colombian geologist made as little as $15,000 per year in U.S. dollar equivalents. Here are some average salaries for 2008—the first number is for the international average; the number in brackets is for the U.S., Canada, and Australia only: 1  Exploration Manager = $133,700 ($132,700). 2  Senior Geologist = $92,800 ($94,600). 3  Project Geologist = $67,200 (67,200). Turning to consultants, we find that in the US the average daily consulting rate for an Exploration Consultant is $734, in Australia $510, and in Canada a mere $480. The top Canadian consultants were charging as much as $800 a day.

what happens to the right side of your body when you have a left sided stroke	An ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage of the blood flow, which may be due to: 1  A clot from another part of the body like the heart or neck. 2  The clot breaks off and flows through the blood until it becomes trapped in a blood vessel supplying the brain. 3  A clot that forms in an artery that supplies blood to the brain.efinition. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is made of a left and a right hemisphere. In most people, the left hemisphere is in charge of the functions on the right-side of the body. It is also involved in abilities such as the ability to speak, or use language.Stroke (also known as a cerebrovascular accident or CVA) usually affects one side of the brain. Movement and sensation for one side of the body is controlled by the opposite side of the brain. This means that if your stroke affected the left side of your brain, you will have problems with the right side of your body.Some problems that happen after stroke are more common with stroke on one side of the brain than the other.1  The left side of the brain controls the ability to speak and understand language in most people.ome problems that happen after stroke are more common with stroke on one side of the brain than the other. 1  The left side of the brain controls the ability to speak and understand language in most people.
what test measures cholesterol	The fasting cholesterol test is the traditional way to measure the level of LDL, but it doesn't measure LDL directly. Instead, your LDL is computed by plugging the measurements for total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides into a formula called the Friedewald equation (named for William Friedewald, who developed it). The test doesn't require any sophisticated lab work, either. The simple, do-it-yourself home cholesterol tests measure total cholesterol. A reading of 200* or below puts you in the desirable category; 200-239 is borderline high; and 240 or more is high.Cholesterol and triglyceride tests are blood tests that measure the total amount of fatty substances (cholesterol and triglycerides) in the blood. Cholesterol travels through the blood attached to a protein. This cholesterol-protein package is called a lipoprotein. Lipoprotein analysis (lipoprotein profile or lipid profile) measures blood levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. 1  Cholesterol. 1 A high HDL level is linked with a lower risk of heart disease. 2  LDL (low-density lipoprotein) carries mostly fat and only a small amount of protein from the liver to other parts of the body. 3  A certain level of LDL in your blood is normal and healthy because LDL moves cholesterol to the parts of your body that need it.

what banks will use one years tax returns to apply for a mortgage	Proof of Income. Besides proof of income, a mortgage lender uses your tax return to determine your debt-to-income ratio. If you make $50,000 per year, have $70,000 worth of student loan debt and apply for a $200,000 mortgage, chances are your debt-to-income ratio is too high. If you file an amended return after you apply for a mortgage, the lender may need proof that you paid any tax you owe and an official reason for the amendment. Filing an amended tax return could delay approval of a loan application.For self-employed borrowers, what used to be the godsend was stated income loans.. In a stated income loan prior to the housing crisis, the lender did not verify the borrower's income using tax returns or W-2s. Nowadays, though, most mortgage lenders want to see at least two years of a self-employed borrower's Schedule C, the tax form that reports income or loss from a business. If income increases between year one and year two, the lender averages the two. If the second year's income is lower, the lender will use that number. With tax day approaching, self-employed professionals planning to apply for a mortgage in the next few years should discuss the issue with their accountant now. If buying or refinancing a home is in your three-year plan, don't write off every business expense you can write off, Ruffner advises.

what is dielectric failure	This provides a safety margin for production variations and the aging of the material.The objective of the dielectric voltage withstand test is to establish the minimum level of electrical insulation necessary to prevent human contact with a potentially harmful voltage and resulting current. This white paper seeks to clarify the theory of dielectric breakdown and the objective of the dielectric voltage withstand test. It explores the applications and limitations of the test in order to better ensure its appropriate use in the product safety approval process.Electrical breakdown in an electric discharge showing the ribbon-like plasma filaments from a Tesla coil. Electrical breakdown or dielectric breakdown is a rapid reduction in the resistance of an electrical insulator when the voltage applied across it exceeds the breakdown voltage. This results in a portion of the insulator becoming electrically conductive. Due to hydrodynamics breakdown in liquids seems to be more complicated: using two spheres in the gap between the electrodes additional pressure is exerted by the non-linear field strength. Electrical breakdown occurs within a gas (or mixture of gases, such as air) when the dielectric strength of the gas is exceeded. Regions of high electrical stress can cause nearby gas to partially ionize and begin conducting

what is piroxicam gel used for	While piroxicam gel is a topical medication, piroxicam is also available as an oral prescription pain reliever in pill form. As an NSAID, piroxicam gel slows or stops the body's production of prostaglandins, the chemicals responsible for causing the inflammation of tissues. Side effects of piroxicam gel may include flu-like symptoms. Bronchial spasms and shortness of breath are side effects of piroxicam gel. Piroxicam and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help dull mild to moderate pain. Piroxicam gel is commonly used to treat painful inflammation caused by arthritis. Minor stomach discomfort is a possible side effect of piroxicam gel, although severe stomach pain could indicate a complication that requires emergency medical attention1 Do not use FELDENE Gel if you have an allergy to: 2  piroxicam (the active ingredient in FELDENE Gel) or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. 3  other medicines containing piroxicam (Feldene, Feldene-D, Pirox, Mobilis, Candyl, Fensaid). 4  aspirin. 5  any other medicine that is a NSAID. 1 Do not use FELDENE Gel if the expiry date marked on the packaging has passed, even though the gel may look alright. 2  Do not use FELDENE Gel if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. 3  Do not let children of 12 years and under use FELDENE Gel.
what is parmesan cheese used for	The term ‘parmesan’ is used in English language, while the original term for the cheese is Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is named after the producing areas of Parma, Modena, Bologna, Reggio Emilia, in Emilia-Romagna, and Mantova, in Lombardy, Italy. Parmesan is used as a common term for cheeses, duplicating true Parmesan cheese, especially outside Europe. In Europe, the name parmesan has been graded as a protected designation of origin. Parmesan Cheese is made from raw cow's milk. 1 Parmesan cheese is used in grated form over pastas, tomato sauces, salads and warm, crusty French and Italian breads. 2  The cheese is also stirred into soup and risotto, to enhance their flavor. 3  Parmesan type can also be eaten in chunks, along with balsamic vinegar.Parmesan, or Parmigiano-Reggiano to give it its proper name, is one of those magical flavour-enhancing ingredients. A few curls of finely shaved parmesan, for example, make a pear and fennel salad taste irresistible, just as a chunk of parmesan rind transforms a slow-simmered minestrone into a gorgeous savoury meal. Parmesan recipes. Originating from the Parma region of Italy, this is one of the world’s most popular cheeses, stamped with the official Parmigiano Reggiano mark as a guarantee of origin. Fragrant and tangy, it has a hard, grainy texture and a buttery yellow colour.
RNA and polypeptides interact with what cell location	The life cycle of an mRNA in a eukaryotic cell. RNA is transcribed in the nucleus; processed, it is transported to the cytoplasm and translated by the ribosome. At the end of its life, the mRNA is degraded. In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase.In simple word or formation of RNA from DNA is known as transcription. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. Promoters are regions of DNA that promote transcription and, in eukaryotes, are found at -30, -75, and -90 base pairs upstream from the start site ofRibosomes consist of two major components: the small ribosomal subunit, which reads the RNA, and the large subunit, which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of proteins. Protein synthesis begins at a start codon AUG near the 5' end of the mRNA. mRNA binds to the P site of the ribosome first. The ribosome is able to identify the start codon by use of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the mRNA in prokaryotes and Kozak box in eukaryotes.
how do i pay for a lyft ride	Lyft matches drivers with passengers who request rides through our smartphone app, and passengers pay automatically through the app. Whether you’re trying to offset costs of your car, cover this month’s bills, or fund your dreams, Lyft will get you there. So, go ahead. Be your own boss. How Lyft Driving Works. Once the ride ends, the app processes pay from the passenger’s saved credit card. Open the app and turn on driver mode. Accept a ride request. Pick up your passenger. Once the ride ends, the app processes pay from the passenger’s saved credit card.

Some find opportunity to work evenings and on weekends in medical facilities that remain open 24 hours a day.
vitamins minerals for tight muscles	Vitamin C. Vitamin C increases the absorption of minerals in the body that are used for muscle contraction including calcium, iron and magnesium. A deficiency in vitamin C, therefore, can inhibit proper muscle function and cause muscle tightness or cramping. You can obtain vitamin C from citrus fruit, broccoli, brussel sprouts, strawberries, cabbage and spinach. Photo Credit vitamins image by Keith Frith from Fotolia.com. Muscle tightness is caused by short, involuntary contractions of the muscles typically due to exercise. Vitamins work together with the other nutrients of the body to improve absorption, circulation and overall function of the muscles, organs and tissues.According to the Office of Dietary Supplements, vitamin E also helps to widen blood vessels and prevent blood clots, which helps to improve circulation. This is beneficial for people with hamstring tightness because blood flow is inhibited in tight muscles, which increases muscle soreness. Food sources of vitamin E include green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli, sunflower and safflower oils and nuts and seeds. Vitamin D. Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins for musculoskeletal health. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to muscle pain and weakness and an increased rate of muscle spasms, which can contribute to muscle tightness.
what makes antibodies and why are antibodies made in the body	Each antibody binds to a specific antigen; an interaction similar to a lock and key. An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shape protein produced by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, via the variable region. The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It is part of the B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation.They are part of the immune (defence) system and are sometimes called immunoglobulins. They are made by B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Antibodies attach to proteins and other chemicals in the body, which they recognise to be foreign (not normally found in the body). The foreign proteins and chemicals that antibodies attach to are called antigens. The immune system 'mistakes' a protein in your body to be a foreign antigen. It then makes antibodies which attach to this protein. This can cause damage or other problems to the affected part of the body. For example, the common cause of an underactive thyroid gland is due to an autoimmune problem.
where do kissing bugs hide in a home	Kissing bugs can hide in cracks and holes in beds, floors, walls, and furniture. They are most likely to be found: 1  Near places where a pet, such as a dog or cat, spends time. 2  In areas where mice or other rodents live. 3  Near beds, especially under mattresses or on furniture close to the bed. The usual treatment is the use of an insecticide that kills the bugs. It is best to prevent bugs from getting into your house: 1  Seal gaps around windows and doors. 2  Fill in any holes or cracks in walls or screens that could let kissing bugs into your house. 3  Let your pets sleep inside, especially at night.Kissing bugs are found in warm southern states of the U.S. and in Mexico, Central America, and South America.

what is a guaranteed payment for irs purposes	From IRS Publication 541: Guaranteed payments are those made by a partnership to a partner that are determined without regard to the partnership's income. A partnership treats guaranteed payments for services, or for the use of capital, as if they were made to a person who is not a partner. This treatment is for purposes of determining gross income and deductible business expenses only. For other tax purposes, guaranteed payments are treated as a partner's distributive share of ordinary income. Guaranteed payments are not subject to income tax withholding. Linda Keith's interpretation:From IRS Publication 541: Guaranteed payments are those made by a partnership to a partner that are determined without regard to the partnership’s income. A partnership treats guaranteed payments for services, or for the use of capital, as if they were made to a person who is not a partner. This treatment is for purposes of determining gross income and deductible business expenses only. For other tax purposes, guaranteed payments are treated as a partner’s distributive share of ordinary income. Guaranteed payments are not subject to income tax withholding. Linda Keith’s interpretation: Typically a guaranteed payment is made to a partner for whom the profit/loss split agreed between the partners would not result in a fair distribution.
what is a cell	Cells are the basic building blocks of living things. The human body is composed of trillions of cells, all with their own specialised function. 1  Cells are the basic structures of all living organisms. 2  Cells provide structure for the body, take in nutrients from food and carry out important functions. 1 Cells provide structure for the body, take in nutrients from food and carry out important functions. 2  Cells group together to form tissues, which in turn group together to form organs, such as the heart and brain. 3  Our cells contain a number of functional structures called organelleThe cell (from Latin cella, meaning small room) is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known living organisms. Cells are the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently, and are often called the building blocks of life. The study of cells is called cell biology. Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. 1 Enclosing the cell is the cell envelope – generally consisting of a cell wall covering a plasma membrane though some bacteria also have a further covering layer called a capsule. 2  The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter.
what can i eat for lunch that's healthy	A healthy, balanced lunch should include three food groups: lean protein, whole-grain carbohydrates, and fruits and vegetables. Roughly half of your plate should be vegetables or fruit. One-quarter should be lean protein. That can include fish, chicken, turkey, tofu or low-fat cottage cheese. And one-quarter of your plate should be whole grains; for example, one slice of whole-grain bread, or a half cup of brown rice, whole-wheat pasta or quinoa. I’ve posted a number of specific lunch ideas in at the end of this article. 1 cup whole-wheat pasta salad made with 4 ounces chicken or tuna and vegetables. Pizza made with a whole-wheat English muffin or whole-wheat pita topped with vegetables and 2 ounces of low-fat cheese, such as part-skim mozzarella or reduced-fat shredded cheeses.1 cup low-fat cottage cheese and a cup of fresh fruit. Beans with a whole-grain tortilla and salsa, shredded lettuce, and tomatoes. Hard-boiled egg with a green salad and ½ pear. Whole-grain crackers or bread with ¼ cup hummus and 2 ounces low-fat cheese and sliced vegetables on top. 1 cup whole-wheat pasta salad made with 4 ounces chicken or tuna and vegetables. Pizza made with a whole-wheat English muffin or whole-wheat pita topped with vegetables and 2 ounces of low-fat cheese, such as part-skim mozzarella or reduced-fat shredded cheeses.
what is a vapor barrier used for	A vapour barrier (or vapour barrier) is any material used for damp proofing, typically a plastic or foil sheet, that resists diffusion of moisture through wall, ceiling and floor assemblies of buildings to prevent interstitial condensation and of packaging. So, the use of vapor barrier should be taken into consideration. Their use has already been legislated within the building code of some countries (such as the U.S., Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland & Wales). How, where, and whether a vapor barrier (vapor diffusion retarder) should be used depends on the climate. Typically, the number of heating degree days (HDD) in an area is used to help make these determinationsThat is the function of air barriers. Confusion on the issue of vapor barriers and air barriers is common. The confusion arises because air often holds a great deal of moisture in the vapor form. When this air moves from location to location due to an air pressure difference, the vapor moves with it. This is a type of migration of water vapor. Incorrect use of vapor barriers is leading to an increase in moisture related problems. Vapor barriers were originally intended to prevent assemblies from getting wet. However, they often prevent assemblies from drying. Vapor barriers installed on the interior of assemblies prevent assemblies from drying inward.
milk and milk products provide liberal amounts of which of the following vitamins	Milk contains small amounts of niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and folate and is not considered a major source of these vitamins in the diet. Milk contains the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The content level of fat soluble vitamins in dairy products depends on the fat content of the product. Reduced fat (2% fat), lowfat (1% fat), and skim milk must be fortified with vitamin A to be nutritionally equivalent to whole milk. Fortification of all milk with vitamin D is voluntary. Milk contains small amounts of vitamins E and K and is not considered a major source of these vitamins in the diet. This page describes the Vitamins and Minerals present in milk, and the Effects of Heat Treatments and Light Exposure on the Vitamin and Mineral Content in Milk. A description of the nutritional function of vitamins and minerals is provided on the Nutritional Components in Milk page in the Nutrition Facts section.2. A general characteristic of the water-soluble vitamins is that they must be consumed frequently. 3. A general characteristic of the fat-soluble vitamins is that excesses are eliminated from the kidneys so they are unlikely to create a problem of toxicity. 4. An explanation why B vitamin deficiencies lead to lack of energy is that many of them function as coenzymes needed for energy metabolism. 5.
what phylum do lobsters belong to	Phylum: Arthropoda. The animals in this phylum all lack back bones and are known as invertebrates. They also all have external skeletons (exoskeleton), jointed appendages and segmented body. The name of this phylum literally means jointed (from Greek arthron) foot (from Greek podos). Arthropods are the largest group of animals in the world and members of this group can be found in every type of environment. Arthropods range in size, from less than a centimeter to over 3 meters. Some of the most commonly known arthropods include ants, butterflies, spiders, shrimp, and lobsters. Subphylum: Crustacea. Animals in this group all have two-parted limbs, two pairs of antennae at some point in their life, and three body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen)Crabs Crabs belong to the subphylum Crustacean, the largest group of marine arthropods, which also includes lobster, shrimp, and krill, a shrimp-like crustacean. All arthropods have a hard exoskeleton made of chiton, a type of protein. This shell provides protection for the animals, and gives support for the attachment of the arthropod's muscles. Although arthropods grow, their exoskeletons do not grow with them. So they must periodically shed, or molt their exoskeletons in favor of a new one. Arthropods (arthro meaning joint, and pod meaning leg) also have jointed appendages
who is a medicare beneficiary	Medicare beneficiary means an individual who is entitled to benefits under medicare part A plan and enrolled under medicare part B plan or enrolled in both medicare part A and part B plan and who resides in the U.S. Medicare beneficiaries pay deductibles and 20 percent coinsurance for most services and equipment. Whenever admitted to a hospital for a new spell of illness or benefit period, a beneficiary is entitled to another 90 days of Part A coverage. In addition, each Medicare beneficiary has a lifetime reserve of 60 days that the beneficiary may elect to use toward one or more hospital stays. 42 C.F.R. § 409.61 [a] [2]. However, if the beneficiary has elected to apply the 60 reserve days to a previous hospital stay, the lifetime reserve is exhaustedWhen a Medicare beneficiary has other insurance (like employer group health coverage), rules dictate which payer is responsible for paying first. Please review the Reporting Other Health Insurance page for information on how and when to report other health plan coverage to CMS. In these cases, Medicare may make a conditional payment to pay the bill. These payments are conditional because if the beneficiary receives an insurance or workers’ compensation settlement, judgment, award, or other payment, Medicare is entitled to be repaid for the items and services it paid.
what is betadine	The difference between Betadine and Iodine, basically, stems from their chemical nature. Iodine is a rare element that usually exists as a diatomic molecule. Betadine is a complex chemical compound containing iodine in a complex form. Both iodine and betadine have numerous commercial uses and unique applications; basically betadine is used as an antiseptic solution and pure iodine is a chemical element in the periodic table. This article explains the chemical nature, uses, and the differences between Betadine and Iodine in detail. Both Betadine and Iodine contain iodine. In Betadine, iodine is present in two forms; in a complex and as the elemental form. Therefore, Betadine is a product which mainly contains iodine. Iodine is a chemical element in the halogen group.(Redirected from Betadine). Betadine is a stable chemical complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone (povidone, PVP) and elemental iodine. It contains from 9.0% to 12.0% available iodine, calculated on a dry basis. This unique complex was discovered in 1955 at the Industrial Toxicology Laboratories in Philadelphia by H. A. Shelanski and M. V. Shelanski. Betadine was immediately marketed, and has since become the universally preferred iodine antiseptic. Betadine is only sold for the purpose of healing wounds, and not as an oral sore throat gargle, as widely thought.
what are some diseases treated in the cardiovascular system	Knowledge center. Cardiovascular diseases include illnesses that involve the blood vessels (veins, arteries and capillaries) or the heart, or both-diseases that affect the cardiovascular system. The cardiovascular system, also called the circulatory system, is the system that moves blood throughout the human body. It is composed of the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. It transports oxygenated blood from the lungs and heart throughout the whole body through the arteries. Examples of diseases that affect the cardiovascular system. 1  Cardiac diseases (Heart diseases) - examples include: - 2  Angina (considered as both a cardiac and vascular disease). - 3  Arrhythmia (problems with the heartbeat, irregular heartbeat). - 4  Congenital heart disease. - 5  Coronary artery disease (CAD).Heart Disease. Heart disease, or coronary artery disease, occurs when the blood vessels that supply oxygen to the heart narrow and stiffen. Smoking, an unhealthy diet, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle all increase the risk of heart disease. A heart attack or stroke can occur if the condition is untreated. This article discusses common circulatory system diseases and the corresponding treatment options. The circulatory system is responsible for moving blood, nutrients, and gases to and from cells to keep the body in proper balance.
what crops can ethanol be sourced from	Ethanol fuel is ethanol (ethyl alcohol), the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. It is most often used as a motor fuel, mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline. The first production car running entirely on ethanol was the Fiat 147, introduced in 1978 in Brazil by Fiat. Nowadays, cars are able to run using 100% ethanol fuel or a mix of Ethanol and gasoline (aka flex-fuel). Ethanol is most commonly used to power automobiles, though it may be used to power other vehicles, such as farm tractors, boats and airplanes. Ethanol (E100) consumption in an engine is approximately 51% higher than for gasoline since the energy per unit volume of ethanol is 34% lower than for gasoline.9.2 billion gallons of ethanol produced (approximately 10 billion gallon capacity). Ethanol can be fermented from many sources of starch, including corn, wheat, grain sorghum, barley, and potatoes, and from sugar crops such as sugar cane and sweet sorghum. Because there has been has been an abundant supply of corn, most of the ethanol made in the United States is from corn. Ethanol is a grain alcohol that can be blended with gasoline and used in motor vehicles. Many gasoline stations provide a blended fuel, which typically is 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline. Vehicles do not need any modifications to use this blend of fuel
what is a wildebeests adaptation	Their main adaptation is the way they travel and migrate in herds, to prevent the amount of predation. Other adaptations are : - They have a wide row of incisors for grazing - … Strong legs for running and stampeding-Eyes on the side of their head for a wider view, if any predators are near. 14 people found this useful. Confidence votes 33. An adaption for a wildabeest would have to be from their climate which is hot an dry. One of their adaptions is able to not drink water for long periods of time. That's one or another would be to have horns to defend thereselve or to run fast to get away from predators.Wildebeest Biology. There are two species of wildebeest, both in Africa. The black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) is less common, and occurs in southern Africa. We are studying the white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), sometimes called the blue wildebeest and common in East Africa. Wildebeest are grazers, allies of antelope, cattle, and other even-toed hooved animals. Calves are redish, with dark heads and a dark strip down their back. Wildebeest live in savannas, grasslands, shrublands, and open forests, often in the company of other grazers such as zebra and gazelles. Wildebeest form small or large groups. In the breeding season, one or a few males will form a territory, and gather females into group
how far in advance can you make hard boiled eggs	Depending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly in 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more. If you are planning to make hard boiled eggs for Easter and want to make sure that the eggs are easy to peel, buy your eggs at least a week ahead of time (two weeks even better, they'll keep). If you need easy-to-peel eggs and you have fresh eggs, you might want to try steaming the eggs for 15 minutes. Pour an inch of water into a pot and insert a steamer basket.Bring to a boil. Place the eggs in the steamer basket, cover and steam for 15 minutes (more or less, check!)1 Place the pan over high heat until it reaches a boil. 2  Turn off heat, cover and let it sit for 13 minutes. 3  After exactly 13 minutes, remove the eggs from the pan and place them in an ice-water bath and let them cool for five minutes. 4  Carefully crack the eggs shells (making sure the majority of the shell is cracked). You can watch this 1 minute video on how to make easy to peel hard boiled eggs or read the step by step directions below. Note: 13 minutes is for LARGE eggs. If you are using medium or fresh yard eggs, you might want to do 11 minutes. Refrigerated hard boiled eggs will not peel well.
common diseases affecting the elephants	Elephants in the wild may succumb to more naturally occurring diseases. For example, anthrax, which is transmitted by rats, can lead to paralysis of the trunk. Heart disease, twisted gut, and parasite infections are other major illnesses contracted by wild elephants. Interestingly, elephants in the wild have been known to seek out their own remedies to deal with illness. For example, digestive dilemmas can be treated by fasting or consuming bitter herbs or bark. Elephant herpes virus affects both wild and captive elephants. Interestingly, it greatly affects young Asian elephants, whereas African elephants generally experience benign versions of the virus. It causes fatal hemorrhagic disease and is believed to be transmitted between elephants through trunk secretions.Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that causes symptoms such as jaundice, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain; hepatitis B is the most serious form of the disease. Chronic infections can cause cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer in later years. The following is a list of the most common infectious diseases throughout the world today. Accurate caseload numbers are difficult to determine, especially because so many of these diseases are endemic to developing countries, where many people do not have access to modern medical care.
who was the very first football player taken in the draft	1936 NFL Draft by Team. The NFL's First NFL Draft - 1936. Held February 8, 1936 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia. Jay Berwanger, B, University of Chicago. On May 19, 1935, the NFL club owners approved a plan devised by future Commissioner Bert Bell. The first NFL draft was held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia on Feb. 8, 1936. Since that time, there has been a college draft held every year resulting in a competitively balanced league. The first-ever Heisman Trophy winner, Jay Berwanger from the University of Chicago, was the first player ever taken in an NFL draft. The Eagles selected the halfback but traded his rights to the Bears. Considering pro football wasn't a very lucrative career in 1936, Berwanger never played in the NFLJay Berwanger of the University of Chicago was the first player ever chosen in an NFL draft. And he never played a down of pro football. The Feb. 8, 1936, inaugural nine-round event at Philadelphia's Ritz-Carlton lacked the grandiose media exposure and fanfare that the now made-for-TV spectacle attracts. Draft's first pick was from Chicago — and he never played in the NFL. Jay Berwanger. Ovie Carter / Chicago Tribune. Jay Berwanger, winner of the first Heisman Trophy. Berwanger played football for the University of Chicago and that is where the original trophy is located.
how many hours of re a week in primary school	Teaching hours are a minority of a teachers' workload, according to this survey. A primary school teacher will spend on average 19 hours a week of timetabled teaching. It's similar for secondary school classroom teachers, averaging 19.6 hours. Secondary school head teachers have much lower levels of classroom time, at 2.8 hours per week. The workload survey confirms that teachers are putting in a lot of hours outside of the school day, before 8am, after 6pm and at weekends. For primary classroom teachers, 23.8% of their hours are worked out of school each week, with secondary head teachers working 21.5% and secondary classroom teachers 21.4%. Primary heads put in more than six hours work every weekend, according to this work diaryTeaching hours are a minority of a teachers' workload, according to this survey. A primary school teacher will spend on average 19 hours a week of timetabled teaching. It's similar for secondary school classroom teachers, averaging 19.6 hours. So how long is the working week? For secondary head teachers, it stretches to an average of 63.3 hours per week-the longest of any of the teaching jobs. Primary classroom teachers worked longer hours - 59.3 hours-than their secondary school counterparts, who worked for 55.7 hours per week. The hours in a secondary academy were slightly less, at 55.2
what is group	In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements together with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation; the addition of any two integers forms another integer. Informally, a subgroup is a group H contained within a bigger one, G. Concretely, the identity element of G is contained in H, and whenever h 1 and h 2 are in H, then so are h1 • h2 and h 1 −1, so the elements of H, equipped with the group operation on G restricted to H, indeed form a group.The study of groups is known as group theory. If there are a finite number of elements, the group is called a finite group and the number of elements is called the group order of the group. A subset of a group that is closed under the group operation and the inverse operation is called a subgroup. The operation with respect to which a group is defined is often called the group operation, and a set is said to be a group under this operation. Elements, , , ... with binary operation between and denoted form a group if. 1. Closure: If and are two elements in, then the product is also in. 2
which food contains iron	Iron is found in food in two forms, heme and non-heme iron. Heme iron, which makes up 40 percent of the iron in meat, poultry, and fish, is well absorbed. Non-heme iron, 60 percent of the iron in animal tissue and all the iron in plants (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts) is less well absorbed. Because vegan diets only contain non-heme iron, vegans should be especially aware of foods that are high in iron and techniques that can promote iron absorption. Fortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed. Commonly eaten combinations, such as beans and tomato sauce or stir-fried tofu and broccoli, also result in generous levels ofFood. The richest sources of heme iron in the diet include lean meat and seafood [ 11 ]. Dietary sources of nonheme iron include nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified grain products. In the United States, about half of dietary iron comes from bread, cereal, and other grain products [ 2, 3, 5 ]. Plants and iron-fortified foods contain nonheme iron only, whereas meat, seafood, and poultry contain both heme and nonheme iron [ 2 ]. Heme iron, which is formed when iron combines with protoporphyrin IX, contributes about 10% to 15% of total iron intakes in western populations [ 3-5 ].
what is professional indemnity insurance retroactive date	There are two dates that are relevant for a Professional Indemnity policy. The first is the inception date (or renewal date) of the policy. This is the start date of the policy period. The second is the Retroactive date, being the date that cover operates back to. To explain how the cover operates, it is important to understand that Professional Indemnity policies are written on what is called a ‘claims made’ basis. When arranging your Professional Indemnity Insurance it is important to understand that there are two fundamental ways in which the cover can be arranged. This can be crucial when you are faced with a large or multiple claims. The two ways of arranging the cover are; Aggregate basis and Any One Claim basis.For example; A company has a professional indemnity policy that they renew on the 1st January 2010. The policy has a Retroactive date of 1st January 2002. They would be covered for claims made against them after 1st January 2010 for any work that they have done since 1st January 2002. back to top.

number of calories in food	In order to answer this question, it helps to define a calorie. A calorie is a unit that is used to measure energy. The Calorie you see on a food package is actually a kilocalorie, or 1,000 calories. A Calorie (kcal) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius.Sometimes the energy content of food is expressed in kilojoules (kj), a metric unit.One kcal equals 4.184 kj.So the Calorie on a food package is 1,000 times larger than the calorie used in chemistry and physics.ometimes the energy content of food is expressed in kilojoules (kj), a metric unit.

what material was the first basketball made of	Although basketball was born in the United States, five of Naismith's original players were Canadians, and the game spread to Canada immediately. It was played in France by 1893; England in 1894; Australia, China, and India between 1895 and 1900; and Japan in 1900. From 1891 through 1893, a soccer ball was used to play basketball. The first basketball was manufactured in 1894. It was 32 in (81 cm) in circumference, or about 4 in (10 cm) larger than a soccer ball. The dedicated basketball was made of laced leather and weighed less than 20 oz (567 g). The first molded ball that eliminated the need for laces was introduced in 1948; its construction and size of 30 in (76 cm) were ruled official in 1949. The rule-setters came from several groups early in the 1900sThe game was invented by physical education teacher James Naismith as a way to keep athletes fit over the winter months. The first ever game of basketball was played with a soccer ball, but a custom made ball was soon manufactured for the game. The materials and techniques for producing has undergone many changes throughout the years. The earliest basketball drew inspiration from the soccer balls of the time. It was made out of leather panels that were stitched together to form a ball. Inside of this was a rubber bladder that provided the necessary inflation.
what is good for muscle spasm in calf	A muscle spasm is a painful, involuntary movement or contraction of a muscle. A muscle spasm is also known as a muscle cramp. Muscle spasms and cramps are not the same as muscle twitching, which refers to very fine involuntary movements (fasciculations) of a small segment of muscle. Skeletal muscles are muscles attached to bones that you control to move your body. Muscle spasms and cramps can also be caused by neuromuscular disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or a spinal cord injury. Movement disorders called dystonias also lead to forceful contractions. Dystonias can also be a complication of stroke. Certain medications can cause involuntary muscle contractions as well.A muscle cramp is a strong, painful contraction or tightening of a muscle that comes on suddenly and lasts from a few seconds to several minutes. It often occurs in the legs. A muscle cramp is also called a charley horse. Nighttime leg cramps are usually sudden spasms, or tightening, of muscles in the calf. The muscle cramps can sometimes happen in the thigh or the foot. You may need to try several different ways to stop a muscle cramp before you find what works best for you. Here are some things you can try: 1  Stretch and massage the muscle. 2  Take a warm shower or bath to relax the muscle. 3  A heating pad placed on the muscle can also help.
can accounting fees be deducted	Only your itemized deductions over $1,500 ($75,000 x 2%) are deductible.

does viking disease affect feet	In early ages, a large fleet of Vikings invaded England and conquered the land for nearly 300 years. It is said that the Vikings were mainly responsible for the disease that spread across England which were also named after them – the Viking’s disease. Vikings disease is the shortening and hardening of tissues. Generally, this can be seen happening in the hands mostly but there are also cases that they occur between the sole of the foot and the toes. Other term for Vikings diseases in hands is the Dupuytren’s disease. The symptoms of Vikings disease is an uneven thickening of the skin on the hand between the palm and the fingers. It will later develop a dimple and when left untreated will then harden.Plantar fascial fibromatosis, also known as Ledderhose's disease, Morbus Ledderhose, and plantar fibromatosis, is a relatively uncommon non-malignant thickening of the feet's deep connective tissue, or fascia. In the beginning, where nodules or cords start growing along tendons of the foot, the disease is minor. A similar disease is Dupuytren's disease, which affects the hand and causes bent hand or fingers. As in most forms of fibromatosis, it is usually benign and its onset varies with each patient. The nodules are typically slow growing and most often found in the central and medial portions of the plantar fascia.
how to find gear ratio	Start with a two-gear train. To be able to determine a gear ratio, you must have at least two gears attached to each other — this is called a gear train.. Usually, the first gear is a drive gear attached to the motor shaft and the second is a driven gear attached to the load shaft. 2. Divide the teeth numbers of the drive and driven gears. The important thing to remember when dealing with gear trains with more than two gears is that only the driver and driven gears (usually the first and last ones) matter. In other words, the idler gears don't affect the gear ratio of the overall train at all.You might also want to know the potential speed for a particular ring gear and pinion ratio or the potential speed for a given set of driveline equipment specifications. In our calculator, we are dividing the number of teeth on the pinion gear by the number of teeth on the ring gear. There are also several ways to determine the ratio manually even if you can't see the number of teeth on the ring gear or pinion. Turn the tire 10 revolutions and also count the number of revolutions of the driveshaft. As a hypothetical value, if you make 20 turns of the tire and the driveshaft turns 36 times, the number of crankshaft turns divided by 1/2 of the tire turns (10) equals the approximate ring gear and pinion ratio, 3.6 in this case.
what kind of terrier is large	A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just 1 kg (2 lb) to over 32 kg (70 lb) and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. 1 Toy terriers: Bred down from larger terriers, these terriers are shown in the Toy or Companion group. 2  Included among these breeds are the English Toy Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. 3  While small, they retain true terrier character and are not submissive  lap dogs These dogs were much larger than the Yorkshire Terrier we know today, and it's thought that they were used primarily to catch rats in the mills. The Clydesdale Terriers were probably crossed with other types of terrier, perhaps the English Black and Tan Toy Terrier and the Skye Terrier. The Waterside Terrier may also have contributed to the development of the Yorkshire Terrier. This was a small dog with a long blue-gray coat. Yorkshire Terrier. Small in size but big in personality, the Yorkshire Terrier makes a feisty but loving companion.

benefit of cooling body temp post heart attack	Cooling saves lifes after a heart attack. Taking the body down to a hypothermic state within hours can save not only heart muscle but improve the severity of a brain injury.Within four minutes of a heart attack brain cells begin to die off.Doctors have had the technology for several years for therapeutic hypothermia.aking the body down to a hypothermic state within hours can save not only heart muscle but improve the severity of a brain injury. Within four minutes of a heart attack brain cells begin to die off. Doctors have had the technology for several years for therapeutic hypothermia.Researchers also found that cooling cardiac arrest patients could result in greater brain function and the ability to perform normal daily tasks, such as bathing and dressing, after recovery. During cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly stops working.If a person's heartbeat is restored but they are comatose, treatment may include lowering the patients' body temperature in an attempt to decrease the amount of oxygen they need, to prevent brain damage.n the 32 years that I've been caring for patients in the coronary care unit, Antman noted, this is a very challenging set of patients to have to deal with. Those who've had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest often have these horrible neurologic outcomes, despite successful resuscitation..
legal drinking age should not be lowered	No, the legal drinking age should not be lowered. Consuming alcohol is very serious responsibility. Not to say that serving your country at the age of 18 isn't equally as serious of a responsibility because it is, however not every 18 year old joins the military. I'm sure if the drinking age were lowered than almost every 18 year would be drinking alcohol. Not to mention, teens are going to drink and find alcohol regardless of the legal drinking age, but if the government made it legal to drink at a younger age we would certainly see more deaths due to drunk driving. Lower it gahhhh. Whether the legal drinking age is 21 or 18, there are going to be problems related to alcohol. And making 21 the legal age to drink doesn’t solve that problem. As a matter of fact, this is one of the reason why we see so many alcohol related deaths among teens.Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405. The legal drinking age should be lowered to about 18 or 19 and young adults allowed to drink in controlled environments such as restaurants, taverns, pubs and official school and university functions. Those under the age of 21 are more likely to be heavy -- sometimes called binge -- drinkers (consuming over 5 drinks at least once a week). For example, 22% of all students under 21 compared to 18% over 21 years of age are heavy drinkers.
what is another name for the phylum deuteromycota	Only their asexual form of reproduction is known, meaning that this group of fungi produces their spores asexually, in the process called sporogenesis. The Deuteromycota (Greek for second fungi) were once considered a formal phylum of the kingdom Fungi. The term is now used only informally, to denote species of fungi that are asexually reproducing members of the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Although Fungi imperfecti/Deuteromycota is no longer formally accepted as a taxon, many of the fungi it included have yet to find a place in modern fungal classification.Deuteromycota. The division Deuteromycota is also called the Fungi Imperfecti or Imperfect Fungi referring to our imperfect knowledge of their complete life cycles. The Deuteromycota are characterized by production of septate mycelium and/or yeasts, and a sexual life cycle that is either unknown or absent. Asexual reproduction is by means of conidia (sing.=conidium) or may be lacking. A conidium may be defined as an asexual spore that is not produced in a sporangium. Parasexual Cycle. There are many species of Deuteromycota in which a sexual stage is not known. Of these, there are, undoubtedly, species in which sexual reproduction occurs only in a restricted set of environmental conditions so that the occurrence of the sexual stage is infrequent.
how much to strength and conditioning coaches make	Salary and Qualifications. The average annual salary for strength and conditioning coaches was $37,000 as of 2013, according to the job website Simply Hired. Minimum requirements for this profession are a bachelor's degree in athletic training, kinesiology or exercise science. Salary by State or District. Average yearly salaries for strength and conditioning coaches vary considerably by geographic location. They earned $58,000 per year in the District of Columbia, according to Simply Hired. They also earned comparatively high salaries in Massachusetts and New York -- $45,000 and $43,000 per year, respectivelyMost strength and conditioning coaches aspire to work at the college or professional level. Head conditioning coaches at the college level are typically paid anywhere from $45,000 to $75,000 annually. Some can earn as much as $200,000, but these higher salaries are rare. Conditioning coaches for professional teams typically earn more than college coaches, but usually less than $100,000 per year. In ideal environments, athletic departments hire one conditioning coach for every 10 to 20 athletes who use the conditioning facility. The actual number of coaches is usually much less. Depending on the size of the athletic program and the level of competition, there might be as few as one or two conditioning coaches.

how many calories a day does a baby need	Calorie needs by age. Infants need a relatively high number of calories for their body weight compared to older children and adults. According to Merck, healthy infants under six month of age need about 50 to 55 calories per pound of body weight. From six months to one year, babies need about 45 calories per pound of body weight. Save. It may seem that a tiny baby needs very few calories each day, but with their bodies growing drastically in the first year, it's important to make sure your infant is receiving plenty of calories from food sources you've discussed with your doctor.For that matter, your baby probably won't consume exactly the same amount of food each day. As a general rule, a 7-month old needs 100 calories per kilogram, which equals approximately 2.2 pounds, per day. Although your baby needs a certain number of calories per pound of body weight, you don't have to drag out the baby scale each morning and figure out how many calories your baby needs that day. Your baby is capable of determining how many calories he needs as long as you offer an adequate amount of food. An average-sized 18.5 pound, 7-month-old boy needs 668 calories per day, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. The average 7-month-old girl weighs slightly less, around 17 pounds and needs approximately 608 calories
what is kerosene made of	Background. Kerosene is an oil distillate commonly used as a fuel or solvent. It is a thin, clear liquid consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons that boil between 302°F and 527°F (150°C and 275°C). While kerosene can be extracted from coal, oil shale, and wood, it is primarily derived from refined petroleum. Other uses were found for kerosene after the demise of oil lamps, and today it is primarily used in residential heating and as a fuel additive. In the late 1990s, annual production of kerosene had grown to approximately 1 billion gal (3.8 billion 1) in the United States alone.Kerosene is often used in the entertainment industry, as a fuel for fire dancing. Kerosene is not usually used as a fuel for indoor fire-dancing as it produces an unpleasant odour which becomes, in sufficient concentration, poisonous. In general such use of fire indoors is not common. Best Answer: Kerosene is obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum at 150 °C and 275 °C (carbon chains from the C12 to C15 range). Typically, kerosene directly distilled from crude oil requires some treatment, either in a Merox unit or a hydrotreater, to reduce its sulfur content and its corrosiveness. Kerosene can also be produced by a hydrocracker, which is used to upgrade the parts of crude oil that would otherwise only be good for fuel oil
definition of genetic diversity	Genetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary. Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The interdependence between genetic and species diversity is delicate. Changes in species diversity lead to changes in the environment, leading to adaptation of the remaining species. Changes in genetic diversity, such as in loss of species, leads to a loss of biological diversity.The loss of genetic diversity is difficult to see or measure. In contrast, the reduction and extinction of populations is far easier to see. Extinction is not only the loss of whole species, but is also preceded by a loss of genetic diversity within the species. Furthermore, the loss of genetic diversity within a species can result in the loss of useful and desirable traits (e.g. resistance to parasites). Reduced diversity may eliminate options to use untapped resources for food production, industry and medicine.
why do cells respire anaerobically	If oxygen does not get to the muscles fast enough for aerobic respiration, the muscles change to anaerobic respiration by processing only the first stage of glucose breakdown and making lactic acid instead. Glucose (sugar) only = carbon dioxide + lactic acid + some energy. In anaerobic respiration only the first stage of sugar breakdown occurs. Lactic acid builds up in the muscles and stops them working. The person breathes faster to take in more oxygen so that lactic acid can be broken down to carbon dioxide and water. This is called anaerobic respiration. Oxygen is needed to full break down the glucose and release all the energy stored in it. In anaerobic respiration glucose cannot be fully broken down and only a small amount of energy is released. Lactic acid stops muscle from working if it builds up.The word equation for aerobic respiration is: Glucose (sugar) + oxygen = carbon dioxide + water + energy The glucose is broken down in two stages. The second stage uses oxygen and yields much energy (18 times more compared with anaerobic respiration). When muscles are working hard, they use up a lot of oxygen. If oxygen does not get to the muscles fast enough for aerobic respiration, the muscles change to anaerobic respiration by processing only the first stage of glucose breakdown and making lactic acid instead.
how long does it take for macadamia nuts to grow	About. Originating from southeastern Queensland in Australia, Macadamia nut trees are a fast growing and medium-sized tree. Their dark green foliage develops in pairs of three or four, with a rare solitary leaf. The flowers are off-white in color, with long spikes ranging from 5-10 inches long.here are many varieties to grow, each with its own unique taste. The trees, which grow from seeds, will take 8-12 years to grow a macadamia nut. The highest quality kernel contains at least 72 percent oil.Elliott says the macadamia nut tree is a handsome, clean evergreen tree with superb ornamental value. It has glossy green foliage and clusters of pretty white to pink blossoms that are pollinated by bees and other insects. The tree will reach a height of 30 feet and spread 15 to 20 feet.The macadamia is a long-lived tree that begins nut production five to seven years after planting. Depending upon variety, nuts reach harvest stage from fall through late winter.Elliott has four named-variety macadamia trees and several volunteers in her orchard.t has glossy green foliage and clusters of pretty white to pink blossoms that are pollinated by bees and other insects.

what are the long parts of a willow tree called	That is how weeping willow got its name. Willow trees have elongated leaves that are green on the upper side and whitish on the bottom side. Color of the leaves changes seasonally. Leaves turn from green to yellow in the autumn. Willow is deciduous plant, which means that it sheds its leaves each winter. Willow has extremely strong and well developed root. Compound isolated from the bark, called salicin is used in the production of very popular and widely used drug: aspirin. This is just one of numerous beneficial compounds that can be found in the willow. People chewed bark of the willow tree to treat fever, inflammation and pain in the past.Bark is the outermost layers of stems and roots of woody plants. Plants with bark include trees, woody vines, and shrubs. Bark refers to all the tissues outside of the vascular cambium and is a nontechnical term. It overlays the wood and consists of the inner bark and the outer bark. The inner bark, which in older stems is living tissue, includes the innermost area of the periderm.

dental hygienist associate degree salary	3rd Highest Paying Associate Degree: Dental Hygienist. Dental Hygienist Median Annual Salary - $70,000 Top Earners - $95,000 Projected Growth in Job Demand - 38% Chances are pretty good that everyone has been to a Dental Hygienist at some point in their life and has a fairly good idea of what this job entails. Facts. After completing a wages study in 2009, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found the average dental hygienist salary countrywide to be $67,860. Hygienists with higher than associate's degree education might earn more, but a higher degree is not a guarantee of a higher salary. The BLS did find several industries paying hygienists slightly higher-than-average salaries. West Coast dental hygienists earned the highest salaries in the country in 2009. Alaska topped the nation's list with annual hygienist salaries of $96,280. In second place was the state of Washington, paying salaries of $90,140. Coming in third was California, at $87,540, followed by Nevada, at $81,090, and Oregon, at $77,520. The majority of dental hygienists qualify for their jobs with two-year associate's degrees. While four-year bachelor's and master's-level programs are available, they're much less common, in part because the associate's degree satisfies the training and experience required to earn dental hygienist licensing

how long do turtle eggs take to hatch	The length of incubation (or amount of time it takes for eggs to hatch) depends a lot on weather conditions. Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other factors influence incubation. Generally, land turtle incubation ranges from 45-90 days (I know that's a long time to wait when you want to see baby turtles!). I suggest you start checking on the nest every couple days starting at the six week point. Since I don't know exactly which species of turtle chose to lay her eggs in your yard, these answers will be very general. If you remember what she looked like, you may be able to get more specific information from the library or from the web sites I've listed at the end of this message.Best Answer: The length of incubation (or amount of time it takes for eggs to hatch) depends a lot on weather conditions.

what is a mine shaft called	The mine shaft is used to admission to an underground mining capability. Horizontal workings off the shaft are known as drifts, galleries or levels. These expand from the central shaft towards the ore body. The point of contact among these levels and the shaft itself is called the inset, shaft station or plat. Underground mining is selected when the rock or mineral is so far to reach using surface mining. Shaft mining is the kind of mine that you normally see in movies where the miner travels straight down into a profound, dark tunnel until he reaches the base.Shafts are vertical or inclined passages which connect the underground workings of the mine with the surface. The top of a shaft is called the collar. Shafts are primarily used for haulage and personnel access. A secondary shaft which has been driven down from within the mine is called a winze. A secondary shaft which has been driven upwards from within the mine is called a raise. Winzes and raises are mainly used as air shafts, ore chutes, manways or for exploratory purposes. Within a drift, the roof is called the back and the side walls are called the rib. The floor may sometimes be referred to as the sill. Headframes are wood or steel structures constructed over a mine shaft or winze to support pulleys used with cables and hoists for haulage and access.

surface temperature temperature of mercury	If one could stand on the scorching surface of Mercury when it is at its closest point to the sun, the sun would appear almost three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth. Temperatures on Mercury's surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to -280 degrees Fahrenheit (-170 degrees Celsius). Because Mercury is so close to the sun, it is hard to directly observe from Earth except during twilight. Mercury is the second smallest planet in the solar system, larger only than previously measured planets, such as Pluto. Mercury is the second densest planet after Earth, with a large iron core having a radius of 1,100 to 1,200 miles (1,800 to 1,900 kilometers), about 75 percent of the planet's radius.Mercury orbits the Sun closer than any other planet in the Solar System, so you’d think that the temperature of Mercury is hot, and hotter. You’d be right. The side of Mercury facing the Sun can reach 700 Kelvin, or 426 degrees Celsius. Mercury and the Sun. Unlike Mercury, Venus is cloaked in a thick atmosphere that traps the Sun’s energy like a greenhouse.

when is the best time of the year to buy appliances?	There are several reasons why May is a better time to buy a new fridge, Shelton says.

The hurricane deductible is a percentage, usually 2%, of the dwelling coverage on a single family home and 2% of the personal property coverage (or $500, whichever is more) on a condominium unit policy. Here’s an example of how the hurricane deductible works: The dwelling coverage on your home is $300,000. A hurricane causes $20,000 in damage. 2% of $300,000 is $6,000, which is your responsibility. The insurance company will then pay the remaining $14,000.The insurance premium is the amount you pay the insurance company every month. The insurance deductible is the set amount which you pay out of pocket for repairs after you mak … e a claim. For example... you may pay $100 to the insurance company every month for the insurance policy and have a $500 deductible. If you file a claim you are expected to pay for $500 of the repairs yourself, while the insurance policy covers anything above that amount up to your max limits. 3 people found this useful. For automobiles, $500 is often the deductible for collision coverage, and $100 and $250 are usual deductibles for comprehensive coverage.

what is molluscum contagiosum infection	Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a viral infection of the skin or occasionally of the mucous membranes, sometimes called water warts. It is caused by a DNA poxvirus called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). MCV has no nonhuman-animal reservoir (infecting primarily humans, though equids can rarely be infected). Four types of MCV are known, MCV-1 to -4; MCV-1 is the most prevalent and MCV-2 is seen usually in adults. The virus may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it, such as a towel, clothing, or toys. This common viral disease has a higher incidence in children, sexually active adults, and those who are immunodeficient, and the infection is most common in children aged one to 11 years old.Causes of Molluscum Contagiosum. Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus (the molluscum contagiosum virus) that is part of the pox virus family. The virus is contagious through direct contact and is more common in children. However, the virus also can be spread by sexual contact and can occur in people with compromised immune systems. A.

what makes a planet a planet nasa	Credit: NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA). The planets in our solar system didn’t appear out of nowhere. Neither did the sun. They were all part of a big cloud of gas and dust. Gravity collected lots of material in the center to create the sun. The left over stuff swirled around the forming sun, colliding and collecting together. Some would have enough gravity to attract even more gas and dust, eventually forming planets. Most of the time these clouds form a type of star called a brown dwarf. They are pretty big compared to most planets, but they are not big enough to turn into the kind of star that makes lots of energy and gives off light. Relative sizes of different planets, our sun, and things in between.Unlike Pluto and Haumea, Makemake has no moon, which makes it difficult to determine the planet's mass and density. Astronomers took advantage of the dwarf planet's passage in front of a star to determine that it lacks a significant atmosphere, a surprise given its similarities to Pluto, which has a thin one. View full size image. Makemake is a dwarf planet in the outer solar system. It was the fourth body identified as a dwarf planet, and was one of the bodies that caused Pluto to lose its status as a planet. Makemake is large enough and bright enough to be studied by a high-end amateur telescope.
what does the gleason score mean	The stage (extent) of a cancer is one of the most important factors in choosing treatment options and predicting a man’s outlook. The stage is based on the prostate biopsy results (including the Gleason score), the PSA level, and any other exams or tests that were done to find out how far the cancer has spread. The PSA can be any value. Stage III: T3, N0, M0, any Gleason score, any PSA: The cancer has grown outside the prostate and may have spread to the seminal vesicles [T3], but it has not spread to nearby lymph nodes [N0] or elsewhere in the body [M0]. The tumor can have any Gleason score and the PSA can be any value. OR. Any T, any N, M1, any Gleason score, any PSA: The cancer may or may not be growing into tissues near the prostate [any T] and may or may not have spread to nearby lymph nodes [any N]Although most often the Gleason score is based on the 2 areas that make up most of the cancer, there are some exceptions when on a core sample there is either a lot of high-grade cancer or there are 3 grades including high-grade cancer. Grades 1 and 2 are not often used for biopsies − most biopsy samples are grade 3 or higher. 1  If the cancerous tissue looks much like normal prostate tissue, a grade of 1 is assigned. 2  If the cancer cells and their growth patterns look very abnormal, a grade of 5 is assigned.

Measure and record the exact mass of the clean aluminum wire. Use tongs to lower the wire into the test tube containing the cupric chloride solution. The wire will extend beyond the height of the tube. Measure and record the remaining mass of the dry Al wire in the data table. Repeat this experiment to obtain data for trial II using the other end of the Al wire. Allow the solid copper to dry overnight or place the containers in a drying oven or under a heat lamp for several hours.5.Lower the. straight. aluminum wire into the test tube containing the copper(II) chloride solution. 6.Place the test tube in a boiling water bath (1 L beaker containing about 800 mL of boiling water on a hot plate set to high) for about 10 to 15 minutes. The reaction is complete when the solution becomes colorless. Do this on some paper towel (not on the lab table/counter, please!). Be careful of the wire’s sharp edges. The safest way to clean the wire is to brush it on a flat surface away from your body. Record the mass of the clean aluminum to the nearest 0.01 g.
what do mandalorians believe	Whatever drove the first humans to adopt Mandalorian customs and language, they remain a people who will accept anyone willing to follow their code, and non-human species are welcomed into the community. Mandalorians believe that you are what you do, not what an accident of birth dictates. But however central armour is to the Mandalorians’ culture and self-image, they never forget that it’s what lies beneath the armour that makes a soldier. “ Verd ori’shya beskar’gam ” (a warrior is more than his armour) is a popular Mando saying. Mando’ade are a frugal people, and many amass sizable fortunes.Whatever drove the first humans to adopt Mandalorian customs and language, they remain a people who will accept anyone willing to follow their code, and non-human species are welcome into the community. Mandalorians believe that you are what you do, not what an accident of birth dictates. But they're still predominantely human, and a large percentage of the population shows genetic markers of the peoples of Concord Dawn and nearby planets. For a people who appear to have little interest in rank and hierarchy, Mandalorians are extremely co-operative in combat. The rugged individuality so marked in their approach to most things is set aside to reach a common goal, and they'll do whatever it takes to achieve their objective.

what age does a juvenile start for dogs	Even though he may look grown up, the stages of puppy development last from birth to a year or even two before he's considered an adult dog. The greatest puppy development changes happen from birth to twelve weeks of age. Flickr/Erica Larson. Even though he may look grown up, the stages of puppy development last from birth to a year or even two before he's considered an adult dog. The greatest puppy development changes happen from birth to twelve weeks of age. But from twelve weeks on, your fur-kid still has lots of growing up to do.Socialization should begin as soon as you get your puppy and often this means at 7 weeks of age. Puppies naturally accept new people, other species and introduction to new situations during the socialization period which occurs between 7 and 14 to 16 weeks of age. Some training can begin as soon as the puppy can open its eyes and walk. Young puppies have short attention spans but you can expect them to begin to learn simple obedience commands such as “sit,” “down,” and “stay,” as young as 7 to 8 weeks of age. Formal dog training has traditionally been delayed until 6 months of age. Actually, this juvenile stage is a very poor time to start. The dog is learning from every experience and delaying training means missed opportunities for the dog to learn how you would like him to behav
are wild mushrooms toxic to dogs	Signs of mushroom toxicity include an upset stomach followed by vomiting and diarrhea, excessive drooling and watery eyes, a slow heartbeat, depression, lethargy, abdominal pain, yellowing of the eyes (jaundice), and seizures. Treatment for Mushroom Toxicity in Pets. Treatment for mushroom toxicity is mainly symptomatic and directed at stabilizing the patient, removing or neutralizing the source of toxicity and treating clinical signs that develop. Typical treatment includes inducing vomiting to decontaminate your pet’s stomach.Symptoms of Wild Mushroom Poisoning in Dogs. Typically, the most poisonous mushrooms, the Amanitas, cause onset of clinical symptoms in dogs 10 to 12 hours after ingestion. False morels show signs of toxicity 6 to 8 hours later and other poisonous mushrooms may cause symptoms within two hours. Initial signs include vomiting, diarrhea, depression, seizures and sometimes disorientation. Early aggressive detoxification is necessary to treat poisonous wild mushroom ingestion. Amanita Mushrooms. The three most dangerous wild mushrooms that dogs may consume in the United States include the Amanitas, false morels and little brown mushrooms. The Amanita mushrooms account for the highest number of fatal mushroom poisonings in dogs as well as humans, and is one of the deadliest poisons in nature.
what are dominant and recessive alleles	You will recall that genes have different forms called alleles. An allele can be recessive or dominant. A recessive allele only shows if the individual has two copies of the recessive allele. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of the allele to have blue eyes. A dominant allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of the allele. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of the allele to have brown eyes (and two copies will still give you brown eyes)Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene, in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus. The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive. For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics. In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele, so these individuals also have round peas. Thus, allele R is dominant to allele r, and allele r is recessive to allele R. This use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case ones for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention.
how long to bake meatloaf	Cover the meatloaf mixture with the rest of the ketchup. 5 Bake for 1 hour at 350°F, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meatloaf reads 155°F. Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes. Then use a metal spatula to gently lift the meatloaf out of the loaf pan to a serving plate. 1 Preheat oven to 350° F, with a rack in the middle of the oven. 2 Melt the butter in a large, thick-bottomed skillet, on medium heat. When the butter starts to foam, add the finely chopped onions, celery, carrot, green onions and garlic to the pan and cook for 5 minutes.Bake for another 10 to 15 minutes: Bake the loaf for another 10 to 15 minutes (about 1 hour total), until the middle of the loaf registers at least 155°F on an instant-read thermometer. Cool 15 minutes before serving: Let the loaf cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. If you baked your meatloaf in a loaf pan, carefully drain off the liquid fat before transferring the meatloaf to a cutting board. Cut into thick slices and serve. 1 Coat the loaf with ketchup or bacon (optional): Spread 1/4 cup of the ketchup mixture over the meatloaf (reserve the other 1/4 cup for later). 2  Alternatively, drape the loaf with bacon slices. 3  Bake for 45 minutes: Bake the meatloaf for 45 minutes, then spread with the remaining 1/4 cup of ketchup, if using.
therapeutic effects of risperdal	In a study of people taking RISPERDAL® CONSTA® , the most common side effects in the treatment of bipolar disorder were weight gain (when used alone) and tremors (when used with lithium or valproate). If you have any questions about RISPERDAL® CONSTA® or your therapy, talk with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088. In a study of people taking RISPERDAL ® CONSTA ® , the most common side effects in the treatment of schizophrenia were headache, slow movements, with tremor, stiffness and a shuffling walk, dizziness, restlessness, tiredness, constipation, indigestion, sleepiness, weight gain, pain in the limbs and dry mouth.Mechanism Of Action. The mechanism of action of RISPERDAL®, in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2) receptor antagonism. The efficacy of RISPERDAL® in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes was established in two short-term (3-week) placebo-controlled trials in patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features.
transient hyperglycemia definition	Conclusion. The prevalence of hyperglycemia was in the range of similar studies other where in the world. 10.3% of patients had diabetes mellitus and 5patients (17.2%) had transient hyperglycemia Underweight and preschool ages were significant predictors of hyperglycemia. Three patients had a diagnosis of Acute Leukemia, but no complete information was available. .Finally 29 patients evaluated for hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. Patients were children with age range of 1 to 14 years old (mean age = 6.26 years old). We divide the patients into two categories.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Stress hyperglycemia (also called stress diabetes or diabetes of injury) is a medical term referring to transient elevation of the blood glucose due to the stress of illness. It usually resolves spontaneously, but must be distinguished from various forms of diabetes mellitus. Stress hyperglycemia is especially common in patients with hypertonic dehydration and those with elevated catecholamine levels (e.g., after emergency department treatment of acute asthma with epinephrine). Steroid diabetes is a specific and prolonged form of stress hyperglycemia. In some people, stress hyperglycemia may indicate a reduced insulin secretory capacity or a reduced sensitivity, and is sometimes the first clue to incipient diabete
how many plums should I eat a day	A person who consumes about 2,000 calories daily should plan to eat 2 cups of fruit a day. This might include one large banana, one-half cup of strawberries and a half-cup of orange juice. To help you get enough fiber, most of your daily fruit intake should be in the form of whole fruits rather than fruit juices. woman over age 50 should consume about. 1  1,600 calories a day if her level of physical activity is low (only performs activities associated with typical day-to-day life)\. 2  1,800 calories daily if she is moderately active (walks the equivalent of 1.5 to 3 miles a day at 3 to 4 miles per hour).California Dried Plums contain about 3 grams of fiber per serving (4-5 California Dried Plums). This makes California Dried Plums a good source of dietary fiber. The Institute of Medicine recommends that people consume 25-38 grams per day for ages 19-50.If you are eating California Dried Plums to increase your fiber intake, introduce dried plums gradually and include sufficient fluids.Most individuals adjust to dietary fiber over time.he Institute of Medicine recommends that people consume 25-38 grams per day for ages 19-50.

cost of ministry truck inspection	The BC Ministry of Transportation vehicle inspection is required when you are bringing a vehicle from another province and you are insuring it in British Columbia (i.e. ICBC); or when a police officer has ordered an inspection. The inspection is prescribed by the BC Ministry of Transportation. The cost for an inspection and inspection decal for an average vehicle is $124.50 plus taxes (e.g. large trucks, heavily modified, or custom vehicles will cost more). At the end of the service the mechanic will discuss his findings with you directly if there are any concerns/issues. The cost of the inspection is dependent on the age and type of vehicle – the average cost is approximately $120.00 plus tax (note, a car 3 years old or newer will cost less; where a large truck may cost $200.00 plus tax).Inspection Deadlines. Vehicles that fail the initial inspection must be repaired within 10 days of the failure notice to avoid an additional full inspection fee assessment. Vehicles repaired and presented for re-inspection within 10 days will be subject to verification of required repairs only. Inspection certificates are valid for 14 days and vehicles must be registered in Alberta before the expiry date. Should the vehicle owner fail to register the vehicle within 14 days a full OOP Vehicle Inspection will be required again
how much energy does an air conditioner use compared to a fan	The energy cost of ceiling fans, on the other hand, is much different. Whereas a 2.5-ton central air conditioner uses about 3,500 watts and a window A/C unit typically uses between 500 to 1,500 watts, a ceiling fan uses only 15 to 95 watts depending on its size and speed. Looking at those New York Times statistics that compared the cost of ceiling fans versus air conditioning a little further, we can do the math on the monthly costs: • A central A/C unit would cost about $129.60 per month. • A window A/C unit would cost about $50.40 per month. • Each ceiling fan would cost about $1.20 per month. That’s a whopping 99% decrease in cooling costs when you use ceiling fans instead of air conditioners. But you don’t have to choose one or the other. One of the biggest cost savings of ceiling fans is that they can be used with your air conditionerThe electricity consumption of a ceiling fan ranges widely depending on the design and the speed setting of the fan. When set at low speed, fans use between 15 and 30 watts, and at high speed, they consume between 50 and 100 watts; energy usage of about 40 watts at medium speed is typical. A central air conditioning unit consumes much more electricity than even several ceiling fans combined; typical central AC energy consumption ranges between 2,000 and 5,000 watts per hour.
how do cells contribute of the growth of tumors and cancerous tissues	Cancer begins when cells in a part of the body start to grow out of control. There are many kinds of cancer, but they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Cancer cell growth is different from normal cell growth. Instead of dying, cancer cells continue to grow and form new, abnormal cells. In most cases the cancer cells form a tumor. Cancer cells can also invade (grow into) other tissues, something that normal cells cannot do. Growing out of control and invading other tissues are what makes a cell a cancer cell. Instead, these cancer cells involve the blood and blood-forming organs and circulate through other tissues where they grow. Cancer cells often travel to other parts of the body, where they begin to grow and form new tumors that replace normal tissue.Cancer develops when the balance is disrupted and cells grow out of control. This disruption can result from uncontrolled cell growth or loss of a cell's ability to self-destruct, resulting in a mass of cells, or a tumor. A benign, or non-cancerous tumor, is the erratic growth of normal-appearing cells. These cells are contained at the original site of growth. However, malignant (cancerous) cells can migrate, or metastasize, to another part of the body via the circulatory or lymphatic systems, and form new tumors at these locations.
is annatto color natural	In these uses, annatto is a natural alternative to synthetic food coloring compounds, but it has been linked to cases of food-related allergies. Annatto is of particular commercial value in the United States because the Food and Drug Administration considers colorants derived from it to be  exempt of certification . In the European Union, annatto has the E number E160b. In the United States, annatto extract is listed as a color additive  exempt from certification  and is informally considered to be a natural coloring.Annatto is a spice and a natural color that is derived from the achiote shrub. Annatto is popularly used as a food color and dye, but at the same time, it is also is a good flavor enhancer. It has a beautiful red color which is helpful in bringing red and orange colors to number of recipes. It comes from the achiote seeds which is a heart shaped, red fruit with spines. Annatto is a natural food colorant that has been used since the ancient times. The color represented fire, sun and blood in early American Indian civilizations. The color was used for food, dying clothes, and coloring the body during ceremonies. Annatto is yellow, natural food colorant obtained from the seeds of the Bixa Orella tree. The pigments that produce this yellow to orange color range are the carotenoids, bixin and norbixin
cost of chemotherapy and radiation treatments for dogs	Cost of Chemotherapy with Other Treatments. 1  If the chemotherapy has to be combined with radiation therapy, the total cost can range between $2,000 and $6,000. 2  Lymphoma, the most common canine cancer, usually requires only chemotherapy and its cost can come up to be around $450 to $500. A typical chemotherapy session involving a visit, diagnosis, discussion over the prognosis as well as the treatment plan can cost a total of $200 or upwards. This is usually dependent on the cancer's location. The usual chemotherapy cost can be anywhere from $200 to $2,000 and even upwards. This cost is applicable to a treatment that lasts for a total of 3 to 6 months. 1  If the chemotherapy has to be combined with radiation therapy, the total cost can range between $2,000 and $6,01 Chemotherapy depends on the size of the dog, and usually ranges from $200 to $2,000 and up, for three to six months of treatment. 2  Radiation therapy usually ranges from $2,000 to $6,000. 3  The treatment combination depends on the type of cancer. 1 Mast cell tumors usually are treated with only surgery, and sometimes radiation or chemotherapy, depending on the stage, and have an average claim amount of $604. 2  Osteosarcoma is sometimes treated with amputation surgery and almost always with chemotherapy, with an average claim amount of $446.
what is furries	The word furry (adj, f'eree), has several meanings, dependent on the context in which it is used. Predominantly, it means consisting of or resembling fur. It also pertains to an interest in anthropomorphic animals and/or mythological or imaginary creatures which possess human or superhuman capabilities. The plural form of furry in all its contexts is furs or furries; the subjects of furry interest are also known as furries. Because people in the fandom tend to identify closely with their avatars (or fursonas), the word is often used to mean a group of furry characters in art or roleplay. To some furs, the sexual attraction to anthropomorphic animals is a part of what makes them furry. This is a topic of much controversy, as it has been the subject of early media attention (such as that from Wired Magazine and Vanity Fair), leading to its becoming a common stereotype of the furry community at large.Furry fandom is also used to refer to the community of people who gather on the Internet and at furry conventions. Furries have a slight preference for pornographic furry artwork over non-pornographic artwork. 17.1% of males reported that when they viewed pornography it is exclusively or near-exclusively furry pornography, and only about 5% reported that pornography was the top factor which got them into the fandom.
dna what is a polymer	Nucleotides. Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, and are polymers of nucleotides. A nucleotide has three components: a pentose (five-carbon sugar), and attached to dif … ferent parts of it a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base (either a purine or a pyrimidine). The monomers (units) of RNA are ribonucleotides, meaning that the pentose is ribose. The monomers of DNA are deoxyribonucleotides, because their sugar is deoxyribose. The nucleotides in a nucleic acid are not all identical. There are four kinds in each nucleic acid, differing only in their bases.Nucleotide-Polymer Formation. DNA and RNA polymers are constructed by forming phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides. In this arrangement, a phosphate group acts as a bridge between the 5′ position of one sugar and the 3′ position of the next. This arrangement is called the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA or RNA; the bases hang off to the side. genetic chains acid individual nucleotides. Nucleotides are the building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Individual nucleotide monomers (single units) are linked together to form polymers, or long chains. DNA chains store genetic information, while RNA chains perform a variety of roles integral to protein synthesis. Individual nucleotides also play important roles in cell metabolism
what is surma made of	Kohl is known by various names in South Asian languages, like sirma or surma in Punjabi and Urdu, kajal in Hindi, Kajjal in Sanskrit,Kajalh in Marathi ,kanmashi in Malayalam, kaadige in Kannada, kaatuka in Telugu and kan mai in Tamil. Kohl is also applied in parts of West Africa by the Fulani and the affiliated Hausa people. In addition, it is used by the Tuareg, Wolof, Mandinka, Soninke, Dagomba, Kanuri, and other predominantly Muslim inhabitants of the Sahel and Sahara regions.PHOTO MYRA IQBAL. The lashings of surma parents apply to their infant’s eyes could lead to anaemia, growth retardation and even kidney problems. Many people think surma or kohl is made of one of antimony’s minerals, stibnite, that was used in Egyptian cosmetics four or five thousand years ago as black eyeliner. But the truth today is that commercially produced surma has less antimony and more Lead Sulphide. What angers her most is the use of surma on wounds. “Parents should never apply surma to a newborn’s umbilical cord, as it can lead to infection, such as tetanus,” she warns. “Surma’s quality, especially its composition, is a mystery. We don’t know what colour particles they are using and what is the metal content of surma.”. Given that the government does not regulate how these cosmetics are made, it is not clear what goes in them
what are bifidobacterium	Probiotics such as bifidobacteria are typically used in cases when a disease occurs or might occur due to a kill-off of normal bacteria. For example, treatment with antibiotics can destroy disease-causing bacteria, but also normal bacteria in the GI (gastrointestinal) and urinary tracts.ifidobacteria are also used to treat a bowel disease called ulcerative colitis, as well as a condition called pouchitis, which sometimes develops after surgery for ulcerative colitis. Some people use Bifidobacteria to prevent a particular bowel infection called necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns.Bifidobacterium is a genus of Gram-positive, nonmotile, often branched anaerobic bacteria.

why is the london eye famous	A predecessor to the London Eye, the Great Wheel, was built for the Empire of India Exhibition at Earls Court and opened to the public on 17 July 1895. Modelled on the original Chicago Ferris Wheel, it was 94 metres (308 ft) tall and 82.3 metres (270 ft) in diameter. Also known as the Millennium Wheel, its official name was originally published as the British Airways London Eye, then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye, then the EDF Energy London Eye. Since mid-January 2015, it has been known in branding as the Coca-Cola London Eye, following an agreement signed in September 2014.The London Eye is on the symbols of the Britain’s capital, and it is a must to visit it during your stay in London. The giant Ferris wheel can be admired on the south side of the Thames River, close to the famous Big Ben. The wheel is also known as the Millennium Wheel. The London eye is 135 meters tall, and it has a diameter of 120 meters. When it was built, in 1999, it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. Now, let’s see the most interesting 10 facts about the London Eye: 1  The London Eye offers the best views over the city. 2  As I said before, it is 135 meters tall, which allows its passengers to admire the city about 25 miles away. 3  For example, in a sunny day, with no clouds, you will be able to see the Windsor Castle.
what is yogurt good for	Despite the hype around “giving up dairy”, the truth is that the right yogurt is extremely good for you and you shouldn’t leave it out of your diet. There are many health benefits from reduction of your risk of certain types of colon cancer, to a stronger immune system and much more. And besides, it tastes great! Yogurt is a fantastic source of protein, a macro nutrient that’s important for everyone, but especially if you workout or exercise regularly. Regular yogurt usually contains around 10-14 grams of protein per eight ounces. This alone amounts to 20% of the daily protein requirement for the average person.Yogurt is a thick, custardy dairy product made from natural bacterial fermentation of milk. To make yogurt, active bacterial cultures are added to milk or cream. There are several different bacteria used to culture yogurt: lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilis and lactobacillus bulgaricus are common choices. Commercially-prepared yogurt is available pretty much anywhere you shop for groceries. How about these benefits of a yogurt a day: 1  It may prevent osteoporosis. 2  Essential to osteoporosis prevention is calcium and vitamin D intake. 3  These two nutrients work together and help to affect bone mass. 4  Yogurt made with added vitamin D can help to keep the bones strong and healthy.

which abnormality is associated with elevated maternal afp	Elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration and fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Stiller RJ, de Regt RH, Suntag S, Baumgarten A, Hobbins JC, Mahoney MJ. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Bridgeport Hospital, Connecticut. Comment in Obstet Gynecol. 1990 Nov;76(5 Pt 1):893-4. Fetal chromosomal results were reviewed from the study population, with the finding of eight major fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Of the eight fetal chromosomal abnormalities, five were associated with elevated amniotic fluid AFP and three were associated with normal amniotic fluid AFP. The sensitivity and specificity of elevated amniotic fluid AFP concentrations in screening for a fetal chromosomal abnormality were 62.5 and 93.3%, respectivelyAlpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein that is normally produced by the fetus' liver. AFP is present in the fluid around the fetus (amniotic fluid) and a small amount crosses the placenta and moves into the mother's blood stream. As the baby grows and produces more AFP, the amount in the mother's blood increases. Between weeks 15 and 20 of a pregnancy, a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screen may be offered. It's usually as part of a set of tests, which screen for genetic problems, called the quad screen. The AFP blood test determines how much AFP is in the mother's blood.
how long do you cook chicken livers for	This Site Might Help You. RE: About how long should I let chicken livers cook in a frying pan with oil once its heated ??r=1220637564? I cut off all the skinny dangly bits, sinew, and made them all somewhat uniform in shape and size. I'm coating them with pepper corn, salt, flour, and a little bit of corn meal. Source(s): long chicken livers cook frying pan oil heated 1220637564: https://biturl.im/a5guN. Audra · 2 months ago. Best Answer: I respecfully disagree with the first poster. I think they should be cooked at a medium high heat until golden brown on both sides, but if you cook them until they are no longer pink-I think they will be dry and taste bitter. I like them just slightly pink in the middle.Place chicken livers and three to four tablespoons of olive oil or chicken fat in the skillet. Cook on high for approximately four minutes until the liver is a light brown color. Flip the chicken livers and cook for another three minutes. Add in other seasonings, cover the skillet and change heat to low. 1 Cook onions in the skillet before placing liver in the pan. 2  Use bacon grease instead of olive oil when cooking. 3  If you save up the skin and chicken fat for awhile, you can make your own schmaltz to top the livers with. 4  You can mash the livers and mix with mayo and cream cheese for a cracker topping
what are the exocrine glands	Endocrine and exocrine glands secrete various products. These include hormones, enzymes, metabolites, and other molecules. In exocrine glands, products of these cells collect in the duct of the gland and flow toward the surface to which the duct is in contact.Since endocrine glands lack ducts, the product is released across the cell membrane into interstitial spaces around the cells. Diffusion of the product into capillaries follows.n exocrine glands, products of these cells collect in the duct of the gland and flow toward the surface to which the duct is in contact.

what are hasidic hats made of	A shtreimel is a fur hat worn by many married Hasidic Orthodox Jewish men on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath) and during other festive occasions. Ukrainian and Lithuanian Hasidim generally do not wear a shtreimel. The Gerrer Hasidim from Poland wear a spodik instead of a shtreimel. Made out of genuine fur, typically from a sable, it is the most expensive article of Hasidic clothing, ranging in price from $1800 to $5400. It is usually the bride's father who purchases the Shtreimel for the groom upon his wedding. SHTREIMEL SABLE FUR TAILS. The Shtreimel is what all married Hasidic men wear on Shabbas. Made out of genuine fur, it is the the most expensive Hasidic item around, ranging in price from $2000 to $4500.In Jerusalem, the shtreimel is also worn by Yerushalmi Jews (non-Hasidim who belong to the original Ashkenazi community of Jerusalem, also known as Perushim). The shtreimel is generally worn only after marriage, except in some Yerushalmi communities, where boys wear it from the age of bar mitzvah. The shtreimel is typically custom-made for the intended wearer, of genuine fur, from the tips of the tails typically of Canadian or Russian sable, stone marten, baum marten (Pine Marten), or American gray fox. The shtreimel is the most costly article of Hasidic clothing, ranging in price from US$1,000 to US$5,400.
what is breo	The incidence of adverse reactions associated with BREO ELLIPTA in Table 1 is based on 2 placebo-controlled, 6-month clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2; n = 1,224 and n = 1,030, respectively). Of the 2,254 subjects, 70% were male and 84% were Caucasian. It is also used to reduce exacerbations (sudden worsening) of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. Common side effects from use of Breo Ellipta are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and oral candidiasis (thrush). Breo Ellipta is dosed as 100 mcg/25 mcg once daily. Breo Ellipta is a dry powder for oral inhalation only. Patients with allergies to milk or milk proteins and patients with sensitivities to any component of Breo Ellipta should not use itBREO is a combination of two medicines—an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medicine called fluticasone furoate, and a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA) medicine called vilanterol—creating the first and only once-daily ICS/LABA that helps improve lung function for a full 24 hours. Your results may vary. 1 Do not use BREO to relieve sudden breathing problems. 2  Always have a rescue inhaler with you to treat sudden symptoms. 3  Do not use BREO if you have a severe allergy to milk proteins or are allergic to any of the ingredients in BREO. 4  Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure.
what does radioactive thymidine do in DNA replication	Thymidine (deoxythymidine; other names deoxyribosylthymine, thymine deoxyriboside) is a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside. Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. In cell biology it is used to synchronize the cells in S phase. Before the boom in thymidine use caused by the need for thymidine for the production of the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), much of the world's thymidine production came from herring sperm. Deoxythymidine is non-toxic and as part of one of the four nucleotides in DNA it is a naturally occurring compound that exists in all living organisms and DNA viruses. RNA has uridine (uracil joined to ribose) instead. Uracil is chemically very similar to thymine, the latter being 5-methyluracil.Thymidine kinases have a key function in the synthesis of DNA and thereby in cell division, as they are part of the unique reaction chain to introduce deoxythymidine into the DNA. Deoxythymidine is present in the body fluids as a result of degradation of DNA from food and from dead cells. The thymidine kinase negative cells are obtained by growing the tumour cell line in the presence of thymidine analogues, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK +) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK + plasma cells.
what is the purpose of connective tissue	For example, red and white blood cells are found in blood, which is a fluid connective tissue. Adipocytes are fat cells found in adipose tissue, or fat. And fibroblasts are cells found in large quantities in many different types of connective tissues. Because the types of connective tissue vary greatly, so do their functions. Adipose, or fat tissue, is a loose connective tissue that is specialized for storage. Although some people may have more adipose tissue than they would like, it does serve the important purpose of warmth and elasticity of certain organs.Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system the outer membranes, the meninges, that cover the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues. Fibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT. Type-I collagen, is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body.

what are subsidiary company for twitter	Twitter International is a subsidiary of Twitter, but it still has its own board, consisting of Macgillivray, Twitter's general coujnsel; Twitter COO Ali Rowghani; and Robert O'Shea, a partner at the Irish law firm Matheson who specializes in creating such international corporate structures. Macgillivray's directorships came to light when we downloaded an annual report for Twitter International, Twitter's Irish subsidiary through which it runs its fast-growing overseas businesses. Twitter has been a voracious acquirer of smaller companies since its purchase of Summize five years ago, as we've noted.In the law of corporations, a corporation or company owned by another corporation that controls at least a majority of the shares. A subsidiary corporation or company is one in which another, generally larger, corporation, known as the parent corporation, owns all or at least a majority of the shares. As the owner of the subsidiary, the parent corporation may control the activities of the subsidiary. When a company is purchased, the parent corporation may determine that the acquired company's name recognition in the market merits making it a subsidiary rather than merging it with the parent. A subsidiary may also produce goods or services that are completely different from those produced by the parent corporation.
what is nutritional yeast used for in cooking	It is popular with vegans and vegetarians and may be used as an ingredient in recipes or as a condiment. While it contains trace amounts of several Vitamins and minerals, it is only a significant source of some B-complex vitamins. Sometimes nutritional yeast is fortified with vitamin B12. Nutritional yeast has a strong flavor that is described as nutty, cheesy, or creamy, which makes it popular as an ingredient in cheese substitutes. It is often used by vegans in place of cheese. Another popular use is as a topping for popcorn. In Australia, it is sometimes sold as savoury yeast flakes.. In New Zealand, it has long been known as Brufax. In the United States it is sometimes referred to as nooch (also spelled nuech), nüch or, yeshi An ethiopian name meaning for a. thousandCooking With Spices: Nutritional Yeast. A deactivated yeast that is sold as a food product, nutritional yeast usually comes in the form of flakes or powder. Often from a strain of yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has a strong, savory flavor that is variously described as cheesy, nutty and tangy. It is popular with vegans as a substitute for cheese in recipes. Nutritional yeast is produced by culturing yeast for several days in a nutrient growth medium (often glucose from beet molasses or sugarcane) and then deactivating it with heat.
where does roast beef come from	SIRLOIN TIP: Also coming from the hindquarters and the next cut of the breaking process is removing the sirloin tip. Unlike it’s name, the sirloin tip doesn’t actually come from the primal cut known as the sirloin, it comes from the round portion of the hindquarter. It is also known as a round tip steak. These steaks are good for marinating and throwing it on the bbq, braising, or using for stew meat. SHORT LOIN: The loin is pretty straight forward unlike the rib portion of the beef. The short loin is where tee bone steaks, porterhouse steaks and new york steaks come from.Beef can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers. Its acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world. Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.). Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The word beef is from the Latin bōs, in contrast to cow sacred Holy animal for worship which is from Middle English cou (both words have the same Indo-European root *gʷou-). After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served.
how much does a licensed insurance agent make	Insurance agents often earn income in the form of commissions based on the amount of insurance they sell. As a result, experienced agents with many clients can earn much more than new agents. The top 10 percent of insurance agents earned more than $115,300 a year, while the bottom 10 percent made less than $25,910. Fifty percent of workers earned between $33,850 and $72,490 a year. BLS data show that Florida led the nation in total employment of insurance agents as of May 2011, with 26,940 jobs. Agents there earned $59,420 a year on average. Agents in Rhode Island had the highest average income in the nation at $81,460 a year, followed by Massachusetts, where they averaged $80,420 a year.Most newly licensed insurance agents leave the industry after less than a year. The significant turnover ratio is clear evidence of how difficult it is to succeed as an insurance agent. Those who remain in the business for at least a few years are much more likely to earn a comfortable living from their efforts. Connecticut, California, New York, and New Jersey round out the top five highest-paying states for insurance agents, and all have annual mean wages in the low to mid $70,000 range. There is no limit to how much money an insurance agent can make. Their income is directly related to their ability to find new customers.
If a hydrogen ion reacts with a hydroxide ion, what substance is formed?	Adding hydroxide ions to 2+ hexaaqua ions These have the form [M(H2O)6]2+. Their acidity is shown in the reaction of the hexaaqua ions with water molecules from the solution: They are acting as acids by donating hydrogen ions to water molecules in the solution. Reaction of hydroxide ions with the hexaaqua ion Statistically, there is far more chance of a hydroxide ion hitting a hexaaqua metal ion than of hitting a hydrogen ion. There are far more hexaaqua ions present. If that happens, you get exactly the same new complex ion formed as aboveThe Hydrogen ion H+ consists of a hydrogen atom missing an electron, in other words its a proton. In water it occurs as the hydronium ion (H3O+) and in higher concentrations m … akes a solution acidic. The Hydroxide ion OH-consists of a hydrogen ion covalently bonded to an oxygen atom that has an extra electron. It makes and aqueous solution basic or alkaline. When any pure metal from Group 1 of the periodic table comes into contact with water, the water, which is H2O, is torn apart in the reaction, and two things will happen. First hydrogen gas will be liberated, and second, OH ions (hydroxide ions) will be formed when they combine with the metal. (It'll get plenty hot, too.) The metal atoms have loaned an electron to the OH part of water to make it OH-, our hydroxide ion
recessive biology definition	(genetics) Of, or pertaining to, a gene (or allele) whose phenotypic expression is masked by a dominant gene (or allele). noun. (1) A recessive allele or trait. (2) An organism whose recessive trait is discernible or expressed. Supplement. In genetics, a recessive gene or allele is one in which the effect is not tangible, or is masked by the effects of the dominant gene. The recessive trait may be expressed when the recessive genes are in homozygous condition or when the dominant gene is not present. That happens when an organism inherits a pair of recessive genes from its parents. Word origin: Latin recess(us) , a withdrawal, receding part + - ive.In genetics, referring to that allele of a gene that is not express ed in the phenotype when the dominant allele is present. Also refers to the phenotype of an individual (homozygote) carrying two recessive alleles. (Figure 8-1) ... ~ allele: an allele that only has an effect on the phenotype when present in the homozygous state. Codominant alleles: pairs of alleles that both affect the phenotype when present in a heterozygote. Locus: the particular position on homologous chromosomes of a gene. ~ Refers to an allele of a gene that is express ed when the dominant allele is not present. An allele express ed only in homozygous form, when the dominant allele is absent
closing cost for a house	Typical closing costs include: title insurance, the appraisal fee, an inspection fee, points on the mortgage, a credit report, attorney’s fees, taxes, and more. They are charges that must be paid for with cash at the closing date. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to cut closing costs when buying a home. Buying a house is an expensive endeavor. Saving for a down payment often takes a potential home buyer years and it typically takes 30 years to pay off a home loan. Added to the down payment and mortgage payments each month is another large cost that comes with buying a house: closing costs.Typically, home buyers will pay between about 2 and 5 percent of the purchase price of their home in closing costs. So, if your home cost $150,000, you might pay between $3,000 and $7,500 in closing costs. On average, buyers pay roughly $3,700 in closing costs, according to a recent survey. Lenders are required by law to give you a good faith estimate (GFE) of what the closing costs on your home will be within three days of when you apply for a loan. Closing costs vary widely based on where you live and the property you buy. Closing costs often include things such as: 1  A fee for running your credit report. 2  A loan origination fee, which lenders charge for processing the loan paperwork for you. 3  Attorney’s fees.
what means the onset of menses	menarche [menär′kē] Etymology: Gk, men, month, archaios, from the beginning. the first menstruation and the commencement of cyclic menstrual function. It usually occurs between 9 and 17 years of age. See also pubarche. menarche The period of menstrual onset; when menstruation begins; the first menstrual discharge. menarche Ob/Gyn The time that menstruation begins; the first menstrual discharge. Cf Menopause. me·nar·che (men-ahr'kē) Establishment of the menstrual function; the time of the first menstrual period. [G. mēn, month, + archē, beginning] menarche The onset of MENSTRUATION.

Menarche defines the onset of menstruation, which is a normal physiologic process that occurs at regular monthly intervals. Menarche typically occurs around age 12 but a few years earlier or later is completely normal. Menarche happens during a time of physical and sexual maturation in adolescence known as puberty.
when does conception occur in pregnancy	The question is often asked exactly when conception occurs, especially if intercourse and ovulation are on separate days. There are many things that come into play here leading up to conception. I will explain each to give you a clearer picture of this wonderful process. I believe that conception happens the minute the sperm and egg combine. This happens within 24 hours after ovulation occurs. The body will not know it’s pregnant until the fertilized egg implants into the uterine wall, some 5 to 12 days after ovulation. Before implantation, there is nothing going on inside the body to detect pregnancyShort answer: Conception occurs when the egg is released from the ovary at ovulation and meets (is fertilized by) the sperm waiting in the fallopian tube. One sperm burrows into the wall of the egg which signals cells to grow and develop. This is the moment of conception, occurring within about 24 hours of ovulation. Fertilization of the egg by the sperm is the actual moment of conception, occurring within about 24 hours after ovulation. With most instances of conception happening within 12 hours of ovulation. Successful conception, however, does not occur until the embryo implants into the endometrium of the uterus. This is when you are considered officially pregnant. Which happens about a week to 10 days after
what is triglycerides	Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body and the most common that we digest. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats. The triglyceride molecule is a form of the chemical glycerol (tri=three molecules of fatty acid + glyceride=glycerol) that contains three fatty acids. To be absorbed, these parts are broken apart in the small intestine, and afterwards are reassembled with cholesterol to form chylomicrons. 1 The triglyceride test measures the level of triglycerides in the blood. 2  Fasting for 9 to 12 hours before the triglyceride test is required. 3  Elevated triglyceride levels may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis. 4  Highly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty liver disease and pancreatitis.Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn't need to use right away into triglycerides. The triglycerides are stored in your fat cells. Later, hormones release triglycerides for energy between meals. Triglycerides store unused calories and provide your body with energy, and cholesterol is used to build cells and certain hormones. Because triglycerides and cholesterol can't dissolve in blood, they circulate throughout your body with the help of proteins that transport the lipids (lipoproteins).
what compounds can catalyze a reaction of a weak nucleophile and a carbonyl group	Here's an early example in which the nucleophile is an OH-group. This reaction step works because the OH-group is a strong nucleophile (and a strong base) very capable of using one of its unshared pairs of electrons to make a new covalent bond. The idea which emerges from this is that a strong nucleophile can attack directly, without help from an acid catalyst. For a weak nucleophile, an acid catalyst is needed so that the carbonyl carbon is prepared to share a pair of electrons as a new covalent bond. If we look at the mechanism of reaction between an aldehyde and an amine, we see how these factors balanceNucleophiles are Lewis bases (such as NH 3 or the OH-ion). The polarity of the C=O double bond can be used to explain the reactions of carbonyl compounds. Aldehydes and ketones react with a source of the hydride (H -) ion because the H-ion is a Lewis base, or nucleophile, that attacks the d + end of the C=O bond. When this happens, the two valence electrons on the H-ion form a covalent bond to the carbon atom. Reactions at the Carbonyl Group. Reagents that attack the electron-rich d-end of the C=O bond are called electrophiles (literally, lovers of electrons). Electrophiles include ions (such as H + and Fe 3+) and neutral molecules (such as AlCl 3 and BF 3) that are Lewis acids, or electron-pair acceptors.

Faculty in 4-year institutions earn higher salaries, on average, than do those in 2-year schools. In 2006–07, faculty salaries averaged $84,249 in private independent institutions, $71,362 in public institutions, and $66,118 in religiously affiliated private colleges and universities. For associate professors, salaries ranged from $56,943 in theology to $98,530 in law, while salaries among full professors ranged from $68,214 in theology to $136,634 in law. During the 2010–11 year, associate professor salaries vary from $59,593 in theology to $93,767 in law.
why are clownfish called clownfish	Clownfish are also known as anemonefish because they live in community with sea anemones. Relationship between clownfish and anemone is called symbiosis, which means that both species have benefits from mutual life. Clownfish is immune to the venom of anemone because it has thick layer of mucus on the surface of the body. Percula clownfish is a type of clownfish which introduces itself to the anemone by performing a dance. Besides dead tentacles and anemone's leftovers, clownfish eats various algae and plankton. Even though anemone provides protection against predators, clownfish is often preyed by large fish, eels and sharksThe clownfish is a type of fish that lives in salt water habitats. It is also called an Anemonefish. Clownfish are typically very bright, orange fish that have three white stripes, one at the head, middle and tail. If you look really closely, you may notice that there are thin black lines around the white stripes. Also, the tips of their fins have a thin black rounded stripe. Clownfish have a few ocean predators, but their greatest threat is humans. People who catch clownfish and keep them as pets in aquariums are making a mistake. There are only ten out of more than one thousand types of anemone that are able to host these fish. Many people put the fish in a tank with the wrong anemone.
average price of a funeral in scotland	THE average cost of a simple funeral has risen to £3,240, according to Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS). The group attacked the postcode lottery of funeral charges in Scotland, where it costs £2,716 in burial costs alone in East Dunbartonshire compared with £715 in East Renfrewshire just seven miles away. CAS head of policy Susan McPhee said: People who have never organised a funeral are often shocked at how expensive it is. There are charges for the grave site as well as fees to the undertakers, the cost of the coffin, etc. Our research has found the average cost in Scotland for a simple funeral is £3,240. That's a lot of money for a family to find at a time of emotional stress-particularly when the bereavement is unexpectedLife and pensions group Royal London says the average cost of a funeral in the UK has risen by nearly 4% in the last year to £3,700, while the UK inflation rate has hovered around zero. It wants policymakers to investigate the causes of rising funeral costs and better government help for people on low incomes. Yeovil £3,152. The most expensive place in the UK is Beckenham in London, where the cost of a burial is £7,216 and a cremation £3,529. The cheapest place is Belfast, where you'll pay about £3,000 for either. Lytham St Annes in Lancashire had the sharpest rise in funeral costs-up 10%.
define an sla	A service-level agreement (SLA) is a part of a service contract where a service is formally defined. Particular aspects of the service-scope, quality, responsibilities-are agreed between the service provider and the service user. A common feature of an SLA is a contracted delivery time (of the service or performance). As an example, Internet service providers and telcos will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. Thus, SLA Management encompasses the SLA contract definition: basic schema with the QoS (quality of service) parameters; SLA negotiation; SLA monitoring; SLA violation detection; and SLA enforcement—according to defined policies.Landslide Sales Force Automation. A service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and its internal or external customers that documents what services the provider will furnish. SLAs originated with network service providers, but are now widely used by telecommunication service providers and cloud computing service providers. In addition to establishing performance metrics, an SLA may include a plan for addressing downtime and documentation for how the service provider will compensate customers in the event of a contract breach.
what year did the legal drinking age change in Ohio?	Although the People of the State of Ohio had previously voted down a change in the drinking age it was changed despite their vote. The reason was simple Federal Blackmail! The Federal Government threatened to cut off Federal Highway Safety Funding to the State of Ohio if it did not change it's drinking age to 21. So the Ohio Legislature said to hell with the vote of the People of the state and changed it to 21. 11:59PM August 18th 1982 changed from 18 to 19 and then 11:59PM august 18th 1983 changed from 19 to 21.

why is a savings account better than a checking account for saving money	Savings accounts always accrue interest. The interest rate depends on the bank, the type of savings account (e.g., see Money Market vs Savings Account), and the amount deposited, but is always higher than the interest rate on checking accounts. As of August 2014, the highest interest rate on savings accounts (in the United States) is about 0.6%. A savings account, as the name suggests, is used to save money for a longer period of time. The idea is to let that money accrue and not use it unless there is an emergency or until it is time to pay for college tuition or purchase a significant item, like a house or car.Fees For savings accounts, the two biggest fees are associated with a minimum balance requirement and transaction fees. Depending on the bank and the exact savings account, these fees vary, but they are usually not a problem for those with a large amount of money in a savings account. For money market funds, there are several fees that investors should be aware of when contemplating an investment in this type of asset. SEE: Stop Paying High Mutual Fund Fees. Returns A savings account might give you anywhere from 0.1 to 1.7%. Money market funds have a range of 1 to 3%. This doesn't mean that you will always get 3% returns, but it does mean your chances of getting up to 3% returns are higher than with
what does urine analysis mean	Urinalysis is a test that evaluates a sample of your urine. Urinalysis is used to detect and assess a wide range of disorders, such as urinary tract infection, kidney disease and diabetes. Urinalysis involves examining the appearance, concentration and content of urine. Abnormal urinalysis results may point to a disease or illness. For example, a urinary tract infection can make urine look cloudy instead of clear. Increased levels of protein in urine can be a sign of kidney disease. Abnormal results of a urinalysis often require more testing and evaluation to uncover the source of the problem. 1  Why it's done.A urine test checks different components of urine, a waste product made by the kidneys. A regular urine test may be done to help find the cause of symptoms. The test can give information about your health and problems you may have. The kidneys take out waste material, minerals, fluids, and other substances from the blood to be passed in the urine. Urine has hundreds of different body wastes. 1 When you do not drink fluids, your kidneys make urine with a small amount of water in it, which has a high specific gravity. 2  pH. 3  The pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline (basic) the urine is. 4  A urine pH of 4 is strongly acidic, 7 is neutral (neither acidic nor alkaline), and 9 is strongly alkaline.
what is an associate professor	There are typically three ranks for faculty within U.S. higher education institutions: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Full Professor. Promotion from one to the next involves a formal process of evaluation of the faculty member's body of work. Typically, faculty begin the path toward tenure as an Assistant Professor and their probationary period may be around six years (depending on the institution and other circumstances, such as previous academic positions or whether the faculty member has taken a leave of absence).Most assistant professors do not yet have tenure associate professor: An Associate Professor is the second level full-time position for college and university instructors who have a Ph.D. Unlike the entry-level full-time position with a Ph.D., called an assistant professor, Associate Professors have tenure. Associate Professors have more administrative responsibilities. They're able to serve on boards and committees whose membership is restricted to tenured faculty. Answers. Best Answer: assistant professor, : Definition: An entry-level faculty position. Most colleges require a doctoral degree although some community colleges may hire master's level graduates. An assistant professor is nobody's assistant; instead she or he is a professor at the lowest rung of the promotion ladder.
civil rights act of 1871 definition	Congress responded on April 20, 1871, with the passage of the Ku Klux Klan Act, originally introduced as a bill to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment and for other purposes..Section 1 of the act covered enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment and was later codified, in part, at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983.Section 2 of the act, codified at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985(3), provided civil and criminal penalties intended to deal with conspiratorial violence of the kind practiced by the Klan.n addition, the Ku Klux Klan Act gave the president power to suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus in order to fight the KKK. President Grant used this power only once, in October 1871, in ten South Carolina counties experiencing high levels of Klan Terrorism.Section 1983 was enacted on April 20, 1871 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and is also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act because one of its primary purposes was to provide a civil remedy against the abuses that were being committed in the southern states, especially by the Ku Klux Klan.ection 1983 was enacted on April 20, 1871 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and is also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act because one of its primary purposes was to provide a civil remedy against the abuses that were being committed in the southern states, especially by the Ku Klux Klan.
how acquire new customer	Any time you make a new business connection or have a satisfied customer, make it a point to ask for referrals--a recommendation for your company. Word of mouth is a great way to acquire new customers, and it doesn't cost you anything. 1. Ask your customers that they refer your business to friends and family. This is particularly important when you know you have made the customer extremely happy. Make it a part of your follow-up routine to ask customers for referrals. Part 1 of 3: Marketing Your Business. Marketing your business is the most effective way to capture prospective customers’ attentions. In the era of social media, you can reach more people than ever before but tried and true methods should not be discounted.How to Scientifically Scale Customer Acquisition. To acquire users and customers, you need to have a system in place for tracking results and you need to constantly be testing. You need to spend between 10-15% of your monthly advertising budget on testing new advertising channels. Then to calculate how much we spent to acquire an average customer, Jud told me to simply take what we spent per month on advertising and divide that figure by the number of new customers we acquired in a month. At the time, we were spending about $100,000 per month on advertising to acquire 330 customers per month

what is octopus food	An octopus (/ˈɒktəpʊs/ or /ˈɒktəpəs/ ; plural: octopuses, octopi, or octopodes; see below) is a cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda. It has two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, it is bilaterally symmetric. An octopus has a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. The giant Pacific octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini, is often cited as the largest known octopus species. Adults usually weigh around 15 kg (33 lb), with an arm span of up to 4.3 m (14 ft). The largest specimen of this species to be scientifically documented was an animal with a live mass of 71 kg (156.5 lb).Octopus is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine, including sushi, takoyaki and akashiyaki. Takoyaki is a ball-shaped snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special takoyaki pan.

what is the purpose of sannyasin	When a Sannyasin (Swami) is initiated, his master gives him a spiritual name in Sanskrit that indicates a remarkable and profound attribute of the disciple’s nature and mission on life. In Sanskrit Sarani means the spiritual path and Ananda means bliss. The purpose of a Karma Sannyasa is also about freedom and renunciation concerning their own definitions of themselves, their mental conditioning, false beliefs, dogmas and their past. They are master of their own life and face life with detachment and equanimity.Swami Vivikananda’s epic poem on the nature and calling of the Sannyasin, the ascetic renunciant path towards enlightenment has been the inspiration for many saints since its original publication. The Song of the Sannyasin, in modern times, is emphasized by the Ramakrishna monks and the Swaminarayan monastic orders. However, it also offers insightful keys to insight and inspiration for all seekers. In this age the ascetic’s life is not for all seekers of wisdom and enlightenment. Commentary on The Song of the Sannyasin. The Poem, Song of Sannyasin, by Swami Vivikenanda, originally composed at Thousand Island Park, New York, July 1895. Quoted, Copied and excerpted from a personal copy of the original Second Edition, Jana Yoga, published by Brahmachari Kapila, Calcutta, 1911. Introduction to Commentary
what is diameter of earth	The circumference of Earth at the equator is about 24,902 miles (40,075 km), but from pole-to-pole — the meridional circumference — Earth is only 24,860 miles (40,008 km) around. This shape, caused by the flattening at the poles, is called an oblate spheroid. Density, mass and volume. Radius, diameter and circumference. The mean radius of Earth is 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers). However, Earth is not quite a sphere. The planet's rotation causes it to bulge at the equator. Earth's equatorial diameter is 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers), but from pole to pole, the diameter is 7,900 miles (12,720 km) — a difference of only 40 miles (64 km)The diameter of the earth at the equator is 12,756.32 kilometers, or 7,926.41 miles, or 41851443 feet.   The diameter of the earth through the poles is 12,715.43 kilometers … , or 7,901.002 miles, or 41717290 feet.   Thus the earth is 41 km, or 25 miles, or 134153 feet wider than it is tall, giving it a slight bulge at the equator. This shape is known as an ellipsoid or more properly, geoid (earth-like ball). The equatorial diameter of the planet Uranus is 51,118 km (31,763 miles).   The equatorial diameter of the planet Earth is 12,576 km (7,926 miles).   Because of its th … icker atmosphere, Uranus is therefore 4 times as wide as Earth, and its volume 63 times that of Earth.
effects of magnesium toxicity	1. Gastrointestinal Effects. When toxicity does occur, the first symptoms are usually gastrointestinal. Because of magnesium’s effects as a laxative, diarrhea is one of the first symptoms associated with an overdose. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, nausea and upset stomach. Many people who have a magnesium overdose will also lose their appetite, causing unintentional weight loss. Cardiovascular Effects. A magnesium overdose has also been associated with hypotension (a severe drop in blood pressure). It can also cause heart rhythms to slow down or become erratic (arrhythmias). When high levels accumulate in the bloodstream, it can even cause cardiac arrest.Very, very low. Magnesium is a mineral that’s found naturally in many foods as well as in your body. However, as with most things, there are dangers associated with getting too much of one thing. Magnesium overdose, which is technically known as hypermagnesemia, is when there is too much magnesium in the blood. Although rare, it can occur in those with chronic health conditions. According to the NIH, symptoms of hypermagnesemia, magnesium toxicity, or magnesium overdose may include: 1  nausea and vomiting. 2  lethargy. 3  muscle weakness. 4  irregular heartbeat. 5  low blood pressure. 6  urine retention. 7  respiratory distress. 8  cardiac arrest

what types of owls are in maryland	Description & Range: Great horned owls are the largest of our tufted owl species in Maryland. As their name states, these birds have two prominent ear tufts also known as ‘horns’ on the sides of their head. Great horned owls are relatively thick-bodied owls that have mottled gray-brown patterns on much of their body. Great horned owls can be found throughout Maryland. In addition, they are the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas. Great horned owls can be found year-round throughout much of North America and parts of South America. Several sub-species of great horned owls can be found within its range.Most owls in Maryland are secretive and active at dusk and dawn or at night. Eighteen species of owls can be found in North America, eight of which occur in Maryland. Barred Owls, Barn Owls, Eastern Screech-Owls and Great-Horned Owls are commonly found throughout Maryland. Though their name implies that they make a screeching sound, their call is more comparable to the “whinny” of a horse. Eastern Screech-Owls hunt at night and eat small rodents, flying insects and small birds. Year-round residents of Maryland, they are fairly common in suburban areas. Click here to check out a Screech Owl Nest Box Plan. The Great-Horned Owl is found in many habitats but prefers dense woodlots bordering open fields
what type of fungus grows on bread	Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: The scientific names of Fungi that grow on bread are 1) Rhizopus nigricans and 2) Mucor stolonifer There is a minor difference between the two and both are commonly referred to as ' Bread Mold ' . These are invariably the first one to ' arrive ' and germinate on a piece of a bread. Mucor and Rhizopus are fungi.Mucor is commonly called pin mould, is saprophytic fungus. It grows on stale moist bread, rotten fruits, decaying vegetables, animal dung etc. Rhizopus is known as black mould. Morphological differences between the two, however, are as followsPenicillium. Fungi of the genus Penicillium, when growing on bread, appear as blue-green to gray fuzzy patches of colonies with white borders. Penicillium fungi grow well at low temperatures, so if you find mold growing on bread kept in the refrigerator, it is probably Penicillium. Apart from ruining your bread, Penicillium was the first mold found to produce antibiotics, and it is used by physicians to kill specific types of bacteria in the body. Bread molds are microscopic fungi that take food and nutrients from the bread they grow on. Molds grow on bread as filamentous, thread-like structures known as hyphae. The spores from dry bread molds float through the air until they find another suitable location to grow and reproduce.

requirements to run for governor in arizona	Like the age requirement, the residency requirement is different from state to state. In Florida, for example, a person must be a resident of the state for at least seven years in order to run for gubernatorial office. However, Texas requires that a person be a resident for five years before running for office. Age Requirements. Though every state has its own minimum age for the office of governor, most use the age of 30 as the minimum age required to run for office. The age requirement is written into each state's constitution and can be changed by the legislative branch onlyMinimum Residency. If you want to be governor of Oklahoma, Missouri or the North Mariana Islands, let's hope you already live there. According to the CSG, you have to be a resident for 10 years before you can run for office. To be governor in Arizona, Kansas or Tennessee, you can live anywhere you want. Connecticut, Michigan, Ohio, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin have residency requirements, but they didn't supply specific information for the CSG's 2012 report. Both states require the governor to be a U.S. citizen for at least 20 years. About two-thirds of the states and territories have a citizenship qualification. The most common requirement is five years and the average is eight years. In Rhode Island, it's 30 days
how much cash should i give for a wedding gift	Wedding planner Lynzie Kent says a general rule is to give a gift that at least covers the cost of your reception dinner. It used to be $100 a head is kind of the going rate, but these days I think it's anywhere between $150 and $250 per person, Kent told CTVNews.ca. Andrews Sunkel said one of the most common questions she's asked is how much cash to give, and she believes it should be based on your relationship with the couple, and what you're comfortable with. But when really pressed for a dollar figure, she said between $100 and $150 per person is appropriate.If you're attending a relative or a friend's wedding, the wedding website suggests somewhere between $100 and $125. TheKnot.com also took the pulse of what real brides and grooms have spent on weddings in the past in its registry study. On average, friends spend $79 on the bride and groom's present, said Miles. Family members, meanwhile, spend an average of $146. Hill says, though, overall wedding guests should assess their budget and how well they know the bride and groom. A lot of times, gift etiquette can also be regional. It's not uncommon to see cash gifts at weddings in the tri-state area, while in the other parts of the country, such as the Midwest or in the southern areas of the U.S., physical gifts or registry items tend to be more common.
how soon do concrete control joints need to be cut	Generally, contraction joints for a 4-inch-thick slab are placed 8 to 10 feet on center maximum in both directions. A 20-foot by 40-foot drive should be divided into eight to 10 equal pieces, one joint lengthwise and three to four joints perpendicular to the length. Then, when the concrete cracks, these cracks will occur at the bottom of the control joints where they can't be seen. If sawcutting is the selected approach, the slab should be cut to a depth of one-fourth of the thickness, for example, a 4-inch slab will need a 1-inch deep cut.Grooving tools cut joints in fresh concrete. Saw cutting cuts joints as soon as the concrete is hard enough that the edges abutting the cut don't chip from the saw blade. Cutting joints soon enough. In hot weather, concrete might crack if joints are not cut within 6-12 hours after finishing concrete. In this condition, if you don't want to use a grooving tool to cut joints, there are early-entry dry-cut lightweight saws that can be used almost immediately after finishing. Control joints are planned cracks which allow for movements caused by temperature changes and drying shrinkage. In other words, if the concrete does crack-you want to have an active role in deciding where it will crack and that it will crack in a straight line instead of randomly. Space joints properly.
why do cells need glucose	Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use. Insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia). If your body does not produce enough insulin or your cells are resistant to the effects of insulin, you may develop hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), which can cause long-term complications if the blood sugar levels stay elevated for long periods of time.Function. The function of glucose in the body is an energy molecule. Cells take up glucose absorbed by the digestive tract and either use the glucose or store it for later. While proteins and fat also provide cells with energy, some body cells -- the cells of the brain in particular -- preferentially rely upon glucose, notes Dr. Lauralee Sherwood in her book, Human Physiology.. Further, glucose breaks down into smaller molecules that provide building blocks for many cellular products. Sources of Glucose. Any food that contains carbohydrates serves as a source of glucose. Even if the food itself doesn't contain glucose, your body can break down sugar and starch in the foods you eat into glucose and other simple sugars, and can then convert the other simple sugars into glucose.
how to grow foxtail lily seed	Planting of foxtail lily flower usually takes place in autumn (around September). The tuberous roots, which are extremely brittle, should be planted about 4 inches deep with at least 2 to 3 feet of spacing between plants. For greater results, make the planting hole wide, leaving the bud or crown facing up. Their tapered spikes of orange, yellow, pink or white flowers can add interest to mixed beds and borders. Unlike other lilies, the foxtail lily plant has unusual tuberous roots rather than a single foxtail lily bulb. Below you will find more on how to plant foxtail lilies and foxtail lily care.In early June, Eremurus (er-e-MEW-rus), perhaps the most spectacular bulbous plant of them all, takes its rightful place, center stage, in the English Walled Garden. Eremurus, commonly known as foxtail lily or desert candle, is a member of the lily family. Not a true bulb but a tuberous root, it stores its food in fleshy, starfish-shaped roots, not in stem or leaf tissue as with true bulbs. In early spring, straplike leaves emerge and form a rosette at the base of the plant. Plant Eremurus tubers in September in full sun and rich, well-draining soil. Supplement the soil with rotted compost or manure. To plant, open a 15-inch wide hole 6 inches deep in the prepared site. Pull up a shallow cone of soil in the middle.
what is the fibrous connective tissue sheath that extends around the muscle	Structure of muscle and its associated tissues is an important topic in courses about human biology, human anatomy and physiology, nursing, and many other health science subjects. Skeletal muscles consist of 100,000s of muscle cells that are also known as muscle fibres. A general example of the structure of muscle and associated tissues is shown below. Above: Diagram of the Structure of Muscle (and associated connective tissue). Periosteum. Periosteum is the outer layer of bone (as illustrated below). It is to this layer that ligaments and tendons are attached. Tendon. Tendons attach muscle to boneConnective tissue from this outer sheath extends into the body of the muscle, subdividing it into columns, or fascicles (these are the strings in stringy meat). Each of these fascicles is thus surrounded by its own connective tissue sheath, which is known as the perimysium (peri = around). Dissection of a muscle fascicle under a microscope reveals that it, in turn, is composed of many muscle fibers, or myofibers. Each is surrounded by a plasma membrane, or sarcolemma, enveloped by a thin connective tissue layer called an endomy-sium (fig. 12.1). Since the connective tissue of the tendons, epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium is continuous, muscle fibers do not normally pull out of the tendons when they contract.
types of clothing used with with synthetic fibers	Natural fiber clothing is more sustainable. When it comes to the sustainability of clothing, natural fiber clothing is generally more sustainable than synthetic fibers which require high energy use and crude oil (source). Additionally, because natural fibers are plant materials, they decompose quickly.atural fiber clothing is made from natural materials that have been used to make clothing for thousands of years. Natural fibers include: 1  Cotton. 2  Linen (made from flax). 3  Silk. 4  Wool. 5  Cashmere. 6  Hemp. 7  Jute (a very coarse fiber used for things like carpets, not clothing).Back to the top. Natural Fibers. Many different natural fibers originating from plants and animals are used in the production of fabric. Cotton fibers are the plant fibers most commonly used in textile materials, with the type of cotton, fiber length, and degree of twist contributing to the diversity of these fibers.Processing techniques and color applications also influence the value of cotton fiber identifications.henever a fiber found on the clothing of a victim matches the known fibers of a suspect's clothing, it can be a significant event. Matching dyed synthetic fibers or dyed natural fibers can be very meaningful, whereas the matching of common fibers such as white cotton or blue denim cotton would be less significant.
who established the first university	1 University of Al-Karaouine: Located in Fes, Morocco, this university originally was a mosque founded in 859 by Fatima al-Fihri, a woman. 2  It developed into one of the leading universities for natural sciences. 3  It wasn’t until 1957 that the university added mathematics, physics, chemistry and foreign languages. 1 University of Bologna: This university was the first higher-learning institute established in the Western world in 1088. 2  The term, “university,” was coined at its creation. 3  Located in Bologna, Italy, this university led the Western world in educational innovations until the period between the two World Wars.Report Abuse. the University of Al-Karaouine located in Fes, Morocco (founded in 859 by Fatima al-Fihri) is considered the oldest continuously-operating degree-granting university in the world by the Guiness Book of World Records. As with all matters medieval, historical facts and figures are up to academic interpretation. Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez, Morroco, has also laid claim to the title of oldest university in the world. Europe's oldest university was founded in 1088 in the northern Italian city of Bologna. The United States's oldest university, Harvard, opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1636, not long after the first English colonists arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony
cost of running a gas versus electric oven	gas vs. electric oven usage cost. I know most people have a preference for using either gas or electric ovens. For those of you shopping for a new or used one to purchase, I thought I'd point out the basic costs of running them so you can weigh out the pros and cons using your local electricity or gas costs. So an oven that is rated at 11,000 watts uses 11 Kilowatts per hour or 11 KWH. The electric company bases their charges on KWH, mine is $.057/KWH. That means my electric oven costs 11 x $.057 = $.63 per hour to run. Propane and Natural Gas ovens are rated in BTU/hour (here anyway). My LP oven uses 60,000 BTU per hour. It takes approximately 1 gallon of propane to burn 90,000 BTU. So my oven uses (60,000/90,000) .67 of a gallon of propane to run for 1 hour. Since propane cost me $2.19 per gallon, my running cost per hour is .67 x $2.19 = $1.46 per hourOn average, gas ovens cost around £9 a year to run, whereas electric ovens cost around £44 a year, so installing a gas oven gives you an annual saving of £35. A microwave, for instance, can offer a cheaper way to cook than by oven, and sometimes cheaper than a hob. Halogen ovens (pictured below) also make bold claims about the amount of energy they save. They can roast a chicken in 30 minutes and use 75pc less electricity than a conventional electric oven.
human rights definition canada	The Charter was signed into law by Queen Elizabeth II of Canada on April 17, 1982, along with the rest of the Act. The Charter was preceded by the Canadian Bill of Rights, which was enacted in 1960. However, the Bill of Rights is only a federal statute, rather than a constitutional document. As a federal statute, it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process and has no application to provincial laws. Many of the rights and freedoms that are protected under the Charter, including the rights to freedom of speech, habeas corpus and the presumption of innocence, have their roots in a set of Canadian laws and legal precedents sometimes known as the Implied Bill of Rights.The Canadian Human Rights Act is a statute passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1977 with the express goal of extending the law to ensure equal opportunity to individuals who may be victims of discriminatory practices based on a set of prohibited grounds such as sex, disability, or religion. The process is generally known as the  Meiorin test  which is similar to the Oakes test justification in a Charter challenge. In June 2012, the House of Commons voted to repeal Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act regarding communication of hate messages. On June 26, 2013, Section 13(1) was finally repealed after a vote in the Senate

Of course these are approximates based on the manufacturer's specs, plus different ovens take longer to heat up than others and retain their heat more or less. There you go.
common and scientific names of fungi	Report Abuse. These are names of groups, they are not names of organisms, so dont have scientific names. common mushroom is fungi and its scientific name is Agaricus. monera means unicellular plant like orgamisms (chlrophyll containing) for ex. spirogyra whose scientific name is also Spirogyra. If you're looking for the scientific names of those kingdoms, you're already done. fungi belong to Fungi, monerans belong to Monera, and protists belong to Protista. If you're looking for species' names, I'll just throw some out there.While an organism can have common names in many languages, it possesses only one scientific name, in Latin. This name is unique, only being used once in science to describe an organism. A scientific name has two parts: the genus name, and the species epithet. Equus is the genus name for horses and their close relatives. There can be many species in a genus. Another species in the genus Equus is Equus burchellii, the plains zebra of Africa. Like a scientific name, the answer has two parts. First, not all organisms have a common name. In the Fungi, many species live in the soil and escape notice in everyday life. Others are not edible, or, at this time, not economically important, and are ignored. These fungi will probably never receive common names, though they all have scientific names

how much commission do estate agents make	Real estate agents make their money by arranging home sales and taking a cut of the sale price, usually in the range of 5 percent to 6 percent. When you're selling a home, this can cost you a substantial amount of money come closing time, since it's the sellers who typically pay the commission. In just about every case, it's the seller who pays the commission. So if you sell a house for $200,000 and your agent charges a 6 percent commission, you'll have to fork over $12,000 worth of the sale price. Typically, the seller's agent and the buyer's agent split the commission 50-50, so in this case each agent would get $6,000. This split is negotiable, thoughIn other words, the 162,560 real estate agents nationwide earned a mean hourly wage of $24.97. The lowest ten percent of real estate agents earn an average $20,700, while the top ten percent make an average of $95,540 annually. For real estate agents employed within a real estate office, the average real estate agent salary is right around normal at $52,870. However, real estate agents employed within the federal government see an annual average paycheck of $75,930, and those employed in residential building construction earn $54,090. Although it depends on which industry the agent is employed in, there are certain states that pay higher for this occupation.
what is epigenetic modification	Epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the epigenome. The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics, which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell (Russell 2010 p. 217 & 230). Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell’s DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence (Russell 2010 p. 475). Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis (Russell 2010 p. 597).Epigenetics literally means above or on top of genetics. It refers to external modifications to DNA that turn genes on or off.. These modifications do not change the DNA sequence, but instead, they affect how cells read genes. Examples of epigenetics. Epigenetic changes alter the physical structure of DNA. One example of an epigenetic change is DNA methylation — the addition of a methyl group, or a chemical cap, to part of the DNA molecule, which prevents certain genes from being expressed. Another example is histone modification. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around
how fast do mud crabs grow	Molting: How Crabs Grow. Crabs (and other crustaceans) cannot grow in a linear fashion like most animals. Because they have a hard outer shell (the exoskeleton) that does not grow, they must shed their shells, a process called molting. Just as we outgrow our clothing, crabs outgrow their shells. The time between molting (the inter-molt period) gets longer with every molt. A 2-year old crab may molt only 3 times, a 3-year old only twice. By the time they are 4 years old, king crabs will molt only once per year. They become sexually mature at about 5 years of age.When eating food, mud crabs use their extremely powerful claws-the larger claw as a ‘crusher’ and the smaller claw as a ‘cutter’. Mud crabs also use their claws to defend themselves and can even drop a claw to facilitate escape. A new, fully functional claw will grow back in three to four months. Reproduction. The male can only mate with a female while her shell is soft, a period of about 48 hours after moulting. The megalopa later moults into a stage one crab. Stage one crabs are only about 4 mm wide, but frequent moults mean that they grow very quickly. It is thought that wild mud crabs grow to around 10 cm in width in about a year and become sexual mature in about two years. The typical life span of a mud crab is thought to be three to four years
how long to roast corn in husk on grill	Preparing Corn for Grilling: If the ears of corn have many layers of husk on them, peel off only the first couple of layers, leaving a few layers for protection. Do not remove all the layers. Soak the whole cobs in a pot of cold water for 15 minutes. Be sure the ears are completely covered with water. This will provide extra moisture for cooking and will steam the corn kernels inside the husks. While the corn is soaking, preheat the barbecue grill to a medium temperature (350 degrees F). Grilled corn on the cob is not only tasty, but grilling your corn never fails to impress your guests. Fresh corn on the cob can be cooked on your barbecue either wrapped in aluminum foil or in its own husks. In the husk makes for a more dramatic presentation, but it's slightly more trouble than using aluminum foil.Heat the grill to medium. Pull the outer husks down the ear to the base. Strip away the silk from each ear of corn by hand. Fold husks back into place, and place the ears of corn in a large bowl of cold water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes. Remove corn from water and shake off excess. Place the corn on the grill, close the cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, or until kernels are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove the husks and eat on the cob or remove the kernels.
when did solidarity take over	Solidarity emerged on 31 August 1980 in Gdańsk at the Lenin Shipyards when the communist government of Poland signed the agreement allowing for its existence. On 17 September 1980, over 20 Inter-factory Founding Committees of free trade unions merged at the congress into one national organization NSZZ Solidarity. In the 1980s, Solidarity was a broad anti-bureaucratic social movement, using the methods of civil resistance to advance the causes of workers' rights and social change.), a Polish non-governmental trade union, began on 14 August 1980, at the Lenin Shipyards (now Gdańsk Shipyards) at its founding by Lech Wałęsa and others. In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad, non-violent, anti-communist social movement that, at its height, claimed some 9.4 million members. It is considered to have contributed greatly to the fall of communism. The Roundtable Talks between the government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state
what is bromfed	1 Bromfed DM Cough Syrup is indicated for relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, associated with allergy or the common cold. 2  Bromfed DM Cough Syrup is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

If you are taking this medication for allergy or hay fever symptoms, take it regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. Improper use of this medication (abuse) may result in serious harm (e.g., brain damage, seizure, death).
what is inside of a teepee	What you might see in a Historical/Traditional Tipi set up and camp. 1  Cover is down to ground all the way around. 2  Set for weather. 3  No fitted liner of any type. 4  Liner can be optional. 5  Use of smoke-flap poles optional. 6  No door poles out front. 7  There can be some cloth, undecorated or lightly decorated, and streamers on poles. 8  Pegs for holding down ... Traditional tipis represent the era from around 1840 to about 1920. They can be from any tribe or area where hide or cloth tipis were built. A cloth tipi was considered a status symbol because of the cost, lightness of material, and increase in size of the lodge. This is the time of the American Indian and his travels through the Great Plains into the reservation periodexists and is an alternate of. Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. A Plains Indian home is called a Teepee, Tepee, or Tipi. Inside the Teepee, it has a small fire on the center as a source of heat and for cooking. A teepe … e (also tepee and tipi) was a cone-shaped Native American home or hut, used by the tribes of the plains. The framework consisted of either 3 main poles or 4, slanted together and secured at the top. Other poles were laid between them to form a structure for the hides.
how long do i charge a car battery before it is fully charged	The more discharged that a battery is, then the longer it will take to recharge it. Usually it takes several hours to effectively recharge a battery. If a battery is very discharged then it can take up to 12 hours or more to recharge it. While recharging a battery, if the battery becomes hot when you touch it then stop charging it. Slow charge: It is best to slow charge the battery. Slow charging rates vary depending on the battery's type and capacity. Fast charge: Repeated fast charges on a battery may overcharge a battery and reduce service life. Step 1: Determine how long to recharge a battery by calculating how much capacity your battery has. For example, an Interstate battery with the part number MT-34 has 120 minutes reserve capacity.A fully charged “12 volt” battery will be at about 12.6V The charger may well take it up to 14.4 or so while charging. About 12.2 volts is 50% and 11.8 is approaching dead. (these voltages at no load, the battery at rest). Anything under 11.0 may indicate a dead cell. During the constant-current charge, the battery charges to about 70 percent in 5–8 hours; the remaining 30 percent is filled with the slower topping charge that lasts another 7–10 hours. The topping charge is essential for the well-being of the battery and can be compared to a little rest after a good meal.
what is the average cost of facelift	Facelift cost comprises three fees: the anesthesia fee, the facility fee, and the surgeon's fee. The surgeon's fee is the majority of the cost, and the most difficult to predict without first knowing the extent of the procedure and the qualifications of the plastic surgeon. The average cost of facelift cosmetic surgery ranges from $6,000 to $15,000. The cost for anesthesia ranges from $1,000 to $1,300. The facility fee (or hospital fee) ranges from $500 to $2,000. Extent of Procedure Affects Facelift Cost. Cost also varies with the extent of the procedure. If the skin is dry and stiff from a lifetime of excessive sun exposure, the facelift procedure is more difficult and time consuming than for more elastic skin.A facelift can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $15,000 based on the extent of treatment, the geographic location of the practice, and many other factors. No one is immune to the effects of aging, and the face is one of the first areas that begins to show wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity. Liposuction itself carries an average cost of about $2,800 in surgeon's fees, depending on the extent of treatment. Fat injection can add several hundreds of dollars to the cost of facelift and other procedures because the fat must be purified, and the injection process adds time to the total duration of surgery.
how long does it take to buy a house in scotland	Buying or selling a home normally takes 2 to 3 months. The process can take longer if you’re part of a chain of buyers and sellers.There are several steps you’ll need to follow: 1  sellers must provide an Energy Performance Certificate for the property.uying or selling a home normally takes 2 to 3 months. The process can take longer if you’re part of a chain of buyers and sellers. There are several steps you’ll need to follow: 1  sellers must provide an Energy Performance Certificate for the property.Well it depends. If the seller has all the documents available, the title is ok and it is a cash purchase it can take as little as a few working days however hardly any purchases are like that. The “date of entry” is the date everything settles and it is agreed by the buyer and seller in the contract negotiations.Sometimes both parties want this date to be early sometimes they want it to be late. The average time between an offer going in and the house changing hands is probably about 8 weeks or so.n Scotland I’m told once an offer for a house is accepted – that’s that and you can’t be gazumped. Gazumping is pretty well unknown in Scotland. This is probably because lawyers are involved right from the offer stage and “formal” or potentially legally binding offers are submitted at an early stage in the process.
what was the purpose of fort vancouver	In May, Lieutenant Peter Puget, under Vancouver's orders, explored more remote western channels, while Vancouver surveyed south of Bainbridge Island's Restoration Point. George Vancouver's 1792 investigations of Puget Sound and environs were for the purpose of seeking scientific and commercial information. His principal assignment, however, was to arrange meetings with Spanish representatives in Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island. He served for 25 years in the British Navy, and commanded the Discovery on her expedition to the North Pacific. In April 1792, George Vancouver entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca and commenced his exploration of Puget Sound. He named every island, mountain, waterway, and point of land in sight -- 75 in all.By Ryan Ware On October 15, 2015 · Add Comment · In Archeology & Collections, News. Fort Vancouver entered the National Park Service in 1948 as Fort Vancouver National Monument. The fort acted to preserve the original Hudson’s Bay stockade of Fort Vancouver. Throughout the years the park was expanded. In 1961, the boundaries were enlarged and the park was renamed Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. In 2011 the army discontinued its operations at the East and South Vancouver Barracks, and in 2012 that area was transferred to the National Park Service as well.
is polaris orp company located	Polaris (α Ursae Minoris, α UMi, commonly the North Star or Pole Star) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor, and the 50th brightest star in the night sky. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. It is a multiple star, comprising the main star, α UMi Aa, which is a supergiant; two smaller companions, α UMi B and α UMi Ab; and two distant components, α UMi C and α UMi D. α UMi B was discovered in 1780 by William Herschel. The moving of Polaris towards, and in the future away from, the celestial pole, is due to the precession of the equinoxes. The celestial pole will move away from α UMi after the 21st century, passing close by Gamma Cephei by about the 41st century.Polaris is located in the constellation of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. It sometimes also goes by the name “Stella Polaris.” The seven stars from which we derive a bear are also known as the Little Dipper. Polaris, the North Star lies at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, whose stars are rather faint. So at any hour of the night, at any time of the year you can readily find Polaris and it is always found in a due northerly direction. If you were at the North Pole, the North Star would be directly overhead. That’s true now, anyway. But Polaris won’t always be the North Star.
how to clean a bike	1 Wash your Bike Frame and Wheels. 2  Go from top to bottom, front to back, using a diluted soap or a dedicated product and the soft bristled brush. 3  Use the brush to scrub the braking surfaces of your rims. 4  Rinse your Bike, being careful not to shoot high pressure water at bearing packs or shock seals. 5  Dry the Bike. If you have a suspended bike, try not to spray water at the seals where the shock pistons move. 1  Clean your Drivetrain. 2  Wet your Bike. 3  Wash your Bike Frame and Wheels. 4  Rinse your Bike, being careful not to shoot high pressure water at bearing packs or shock seals. 5  Dry the Bike. 6  Lubricate.The wheels make it difficult to clean the parts of the bike closest to the ground and tire, which are often the dirtiest areas. 5. Use the soft-side of a sponge to clean the frame. Scrub up and down the entire frame, which is the metal body of the bike, with a sponge and soapy water. Never use a rough or abrasive brush on your frame, even with persistent stains. This can scratch your paint off and make the bike prone to rusting. Use the abrasive side of a sponge to clean off the edges and lightly wipe down each spoke so your bike looks clean and sparkly. 1  Use a toothbrush to scrub the hub-- the small cylinder in the center of the wheel -- and the nuts and bolts on either side of it.
how do manganese nodules form	Although the conditions for the formation of manganese nodules are the same in all four of the major regions, their metal contents vary from place to place. The highest manganese content is 34 per cent in the Peru Basin nodules, while the highest iron content is in the Penrhyn Basin nodules with 16.1 per cent. At some sites they are more densely grouped. No nodules at all are found in stony areas. On the average, one square metre in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone contains around 15 kilograms of manganese nodules. Especially rich areas can have up to 75 kilograms.Polymetallic nodules, also called manganese nodules, are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization. When visible to the naked eye, it can be a small test (shell) of a microfossil (radiolarian or foraminifer), a phosphatized shark tooth, basalt debris or even fragments of earlier nodules. Polymetallic nodules. The chemical composition of nodules varies according to the kind of manganese minerals and the size and characteristics of the core. Those of greatest economic interest contain manganese (27-30%), nickel (1.25-1.5 %), copper (1-1.4 %) and cobalt (0.2-0.25 %).
what kind of parachute did jacques garnerin use?	A parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag, or in the case of ram-air parachutes, aerodynamic lift. Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong cloth, originally silk, now most commonly nylon. Also in 1911, Grant Morton made the first parachute jump from an airplane, a Wright Model B piloted by Phil Parmalee, at Venice Beach, California. Morton's device was of the throw-out type where he held the parachute in his arms as he left the aircraft.Parachutes. The parachute was invented by Andre André Jacques (garnerin-1769). 1823 it consisted of a white canvas canopy 23 feet in. Diameter the parachute had 36 ribs and, lines was-semi, rigid making it look like a very large. Umbrella garnerin made his first successful parachute jump Above paris on 22nd, october. 1797 As Garnerin failed to include an air vent at the top of his parachute, he oscillated wildly in his descent. However, he landed unhurt half a mile from the balloon's takeoff site. Garnerin therefore became the first man to design a parachute that was capable of slowing a man's fall from a high altitude. Garnerin made exhibition jumps all over Europe including one of 8,000 feet (2,438 m) over London in September 1802. In the 1880s parachutes were used by circus showman jumping from balloons.
what metal is a bicycle made of	The Velocipede, made with wooden wheels and an iron frame and tires, won the nickname of the boneshaker.. The 1860s proved to be an important decade for bicycle improvements with the inventions of ball-bearing hubs, metal-spoked wheels, solid rubber tires, and a lever-operated, four-speed gearshift. Around 1866 an unusual version of the Velocipede was created in England by James Stanley. During the 1890s bicycles became very popular, and the basic elements of the modern bicycle were already in place. In the first half of the 20th century, stronger steel alloys allowed thinner frame tubing which made the bicycles lighter and faster. Derailleur gears were also developed, allowing smoother riding.Four popular bicycle frame materials are steel, aluminum, titanium and carbon fiber. Beryllium, Metal Matrix Composites and other materials have so far demonstrated limited practicality in bicycle frames. Mysterious and seemingly miraculous beryllium is one-third the weight of aluminum and six times as stiff as steel. This is another reason to look for metal frame parts (such as dropouts) that are made of titanium rather than aluminum if you are shopping for a carbon fiber bike. Discontinuity of materials can create stress-risers where the carbon fiber meets the other material. The stress-risers can lead to failure.
what is embalming	Embalming a body is a multi-step procedure used to preserve a body and delay decomposition for a short time, and temporarily restore a life-like appearance. When a body is embalmed, the bodily fluids are removed and are replaced with formaldehyde-based chemical solutions that will delay decomposition. Then the body is cosmetically prepared for viewing by styling the hair, applying makeup, and setting the facial features. Green Embalming. If you wish to have the body embalmed in an environmentally and healthfully safe way, traditional embalming fluid can be replaced with non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, formaldehyde-free embalming fluid, which is often made from biodegradable essential oils.Embalming is the art and science of preserving human remains by treating them (in its modern form with chemicals) to forestall decomposition. The intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral, for religious reasons, or for medical and scientific purposes such as their use as anatomical specimens. 1 The embalming solution is injected with a centrifugal pump and the embalmer massages the body to break up circulatory clots as to ensure the proper distribution of the embalming fluid. 2  This process of raising vessels with injection and drainage from a solitary location is known as a single-point injection.
what is a stoma	Surgical procedures in which stomata are created are ended in the suffix-ostomy and begin with a prefix denoting the organ or area being operated on. In anatomy, a natural stoma is any opening in the body, such as the mouth. Any hollow organ can be manipulated into an artificial stoma as necessary. This includes the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon, pleural cavity, ureters, urinary bladder, and kidney pelvis. The point of exiting is what is known as the stoma. For greatest success and to minimize negative effects, it is preferable to perform this procedure as low down in the tract as possible, as this allows the maximal amount of natural digestion to occur before eliminating fecal matter from the body.One well-known form of an artificial stoma is a colostomy, which is a surgically created opening in the large intestine that allows the removal of feces out of the body, bypassing the rectum, to drain into a pouch or other collection device. The historical practice of trepanation was also a type of stoma. The point of exiting is what is known as the stoma. For greatest success and to minimize negative effects, it is preferable to perform this procedure as low down in the tract as possible, as this allows the maximal amount of natural digestion to occur before eliminating fecal matter from the body.
chlorophyll molecules that capture energy are organized into groups called	Eventually, the energy may be absorbed by the chlorophyll at the reaction center. At that point the reactions leading to ATP and NADPH production can occur. The pigment molecules are organized in groups of around 200 to 300 called photosystems. Packets of light energy (or quantas) are called photons. A photon striking, and being absorbed by a chlorophyll. molecule imparts a small amount energy, which raises an electron to a higher energy level. Remember that atoms are organized with their electrons in shells surrounding the nucleus.Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis, which allows plants to absorb energy from light. Chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. In these complexes, chlorophyll serves two primary functions. The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy by resonance energy transfer to a specific chlorophyll pair in the reaction center of the photosystems. Chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is a term used for several closely related green pigments found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants. Its name is derived from the Greek words χλωρός, chloros (green) and φύλλον, phyllon (leaf).
practical applications of weighted average cost for inventory	When using the weighted average method, divide the cost of goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale, which yields the weighted-average cost per unit. In this calculation, the cost of goods available for sale is the sum of beginning inventory and net purchases. The total of all purchased or beginning inventory units is 450 (150 beginning inventory + 300 purchased). The weighted average cost per unit is therefore $257.78 ($116,000 ÷ 450 units.). The ending inventory valuation is $45,112 (175 units × $257.78 weighted average cost), while the cost of goods sold valuation is $70,890 (275 units × $257.78 weighted average cost). The sum of these two amounts (less a rounding error) equals the $116,000 total actual cost of all purchases and beginning inventoryIf the company uses weighted average method for inventory valuation, the value of inventory as on March 31, 2005 is: a. $11967 b. $12000 c. $12500 …. Inventory Ledger Account Exercise. Below is the records of receipts and issues of a certain material in a factory for the month ending 30th September, 2008. The value of our closing inventories in this example would be calculated as follows: Using the First-In-First-Out method, our closing inventory comes to $1,100. This equates to a cost of $1.10 per lollypop ($1,100/1,000 lollypops).
what is one property of a suspension that is different from that of a solution or a colloid?	In a solution the components are completely and event mixed throughout one another so that the largest distinct particles of any one substance are its component atoms, molecul … es, or ions. In a colloid one of the substance, usually the one that there is less of, takes the form of particles that stay suspended in the other, more abundant substance. A suspension is similar to a colloid, the only difference being that if the mixture is allowed to sit undisturbed the particle will eventually settle to the bottom.In summary: A solution is always transparent, light passes through with no scattering from solute particles which are molecule in size. The solution is homogeneous and does not settle out. A solution cannot be filtered but can be separated using the process of distillation. A suspension is cloudy and heterogeneous. The particles are larger than 10,000 Angstroms which allows them to be filtered. If a suspension is allowed to stand the particles will separate out. A colloid is intermediate between a solution and a suspension. While a suspension will separate out a colloid will not. Colloids can be distinguished from solutions using the Tyndall effect. Light passing through a colloidal dispersion, such as smoky or foggy air, will be reflected by the larger particles and the light beam will be visible.

what is EMS, muscle condition	Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome (EMS) is an incurable and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition linked to the ingestion of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain). The first case of Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome was reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in November 1989, although some cases had occurred as early as 2–3 years before this. In total, more than 1,500 cases of EMS were reported to the CDC, as well as at least 37 EMS-associated deaths.EMS stands for Electrical Muscle Stimulation. EMS is predominately used by doctors and to prevent, or reduce, muscle atrophy. Atrophy is the weakening and loss of muscle tone, which is usually experienced after surgeries or injuries. EMS will have pain management attributes in regards to muscle related pain, such as a spastic muscle, sore muscles, or tight muscles. A TENS device is more suited for nerve related pain conditions (acute and chronic conditions). While using the EMS, the brain sends a nerve impulse to the motor point of your muscle

what are good carbohydrates and bad carbohydrates	Simple carbohydrates occur naturally in milk products. Carbohydrates provide your body with glucose it needs to function properly. Two types of carbohydrates exist: complex carbohydrates and simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates take time to break down into glucose. Foods rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber are called good carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found in foods such as fruits and milk products and sugars added during food processing. Foods rich in white flour and added sugars are called bad carbohydrates. While your body needs carbs daily to function properly, choosing foods containing good carbohydrates over bad carbs is beneficial for your health. Good (healthy) carbs help you maintain a healthy body weight, feel full for long periods of time, and can even help lower blood cholesterol and heart disease risks. Nuts and seeds also contain small amounts of carbs. List of Bad Carbs. Bad carbs are found in foods that contain added sugar but few, if any, additional nutrients. These foods don't keep you feeling full very long like good carbohydrates do. Examples of bad carbs include sugary drinks like soda and lemonade, doughnuts, pastries, cookies, candies, syrups, table sugar, many types of chips and crackers, French fries, fried foods, chips, white rice, and white bread
what is the average cost of a nursing home in north carolina	You can look up the costs for any state at Home Health Care Costs Across The Nation. Compare Costs Of Home Health Care Against Other Long Term Care. For comparison, the average daily cost for a private room in a nursing home in North Carolina was $228 ($83,220 annually). The monthly private-pay base rate in an assisted living facility with one-bedroom apartments or private rooms with private baths was $3,728 per month ($44,736 for 12 months). If you or a family member needs home health care, and you live in North Carolina, plan on it costing about $19 per hour. That's the average cost in the state for a Health Aide, according to a survey published by the MetLife Mature Market Institute*.North Carolina's Medicaid Income Limit. People who receive SSI already qualify to receive Medicaid long-term care in North Carolina. If you don't receive SSI, and you are 65 or older, blind, or disabled, you must have income below $973/month for a household of one or $1,311/month for a household of two (in 2014). Assets. North Carolina assumes that half of the assets that you had at the time of your first admission to a nursing home (called the “community spouse resource allowance,” or CSRA) belong to your spouse, subject to a limit that changes annually. The limit for the CSRA in 2014 is $117,240. The minimum is $23,448.
what is best to bond broken water features	These hydrogen-bond attractions can occur between molecules (intermolecular) or within different parts of a single molecule (intramolecular). The hydrogen bond (5 to 30 kJ/mole) is stronger than a van der Waals interaction, but weaker than covalent or ionic bonds. This type of bond can occur in inorganic molecules such as water and in organic molecules like DNA and proteins. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water (100 °C) compared to the other group 16 hydrides that have no hydrogen bonds. A hydrogen attached to carbon can also participate in hydrogen bonding when the carbon atom is bound to electronegative atoms, as is the case in chloroform, CHCl 3. An example of a hydrogen bond donor is ethanol, which has a hydrogen bonded to an oxygen.Liquid water is exceptional in having approximately as many hydrogen bonds as it has covalent bonds. Shown right is the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule as the temperature rises with the line-width showing the approximate disparity between different experimental methods (data from [ 2264 ]). Such cooperativity is a fundamental property of liquid water where hydrogen bonds are up to 250% stronger than the single hydrogen bond in the dimer [ 77 ]. A strong base at the end of a chain may strengthen the bonding further.
how good is ducted heat pumps	Types of heat pumps. An air source heat pump can provide whole-house heating and cooling when it is fully-ducted throughout the home. These systems are ideal for new home construction, or added to existing forced-air systems. Adding a heat pump to a forced-air furnace will optimize the efficiency of the heating system. A ductless heat pump (or mini-split system) makes a good retrofit to homes with “non-ducted” heating systems. Since they have no ducts, they avoid the energy losses associated with ductwork of central forced air systems.A ducted heat pump can deliver 1.5 to over 3 times more heat energy to a home than the electric energy it consumes. This is possible because a heat pump moves heat from the air rather than converting it from a fuel, like in combustion heating systems. This cycle can be reversed in the summer to cool your home. The mild Pacific Northwest climate provides ideal conditions for high-efficiency heat pumps. 1  Save energy and money. 2  If you heat with electricity, a heat pump can reduce the amount of energy you use for heating by as much as 30%-40%. 1 Save energy and money. 2  If you heat with electricity, a heat pump can reduce the amount of energy you use for heating by as much as 30%-40%. 3  Comfort. 4  Heat pumps deliver constant, even temperatures and also balance humidity.
how to take an inverse of a number	Shares & Saves. Save. A number can have two inverses. One inverse is the additive inverse, which is the value that when added with the original number will equal zero. To find the additive inverse, just make the original value negative if it's positive or positive if it's negative. Instructions. Write the number as the denominator of a fraction that has 1 as a numerator to find the reciprocal of an integer. For example, the reciprocal of 5 is 1/5. Place a decimal number as the denominator of a fraction with 1 as the numerator, then divide to calculate the reciprocal of a decimal. For example, the reciprocal of 0.5 is 1/0.5In mathematics, a multiplicative inverse or reciprocal for a number x, denoted by 1/ x or x −1, is a number which when multiplied by x yields the multiplicative identity, 1. The multiplicative inverse of a fraction a / b is b / a. For the multiplicative inverse of a real number, divide 1 by the number. For example, the reciprocal of 5 is one fifth (1/5 or 0.2), and the reciprocal of 0.25 is 1 divided by 0.25, or 4. The notation f −1 is sometimes also used for the inverse function of the function f, which is not in general equal to the multiplicative inverse. For example, the multiplicative inverse 1/(sin x) = (sin x)−1 is different from the inverse sin of x, denoted sin−1 x or arcsin x.

what is the difference between b cell receptors and antibodies	B-cells become Plasma Cells. When a B-cell receptor connects to its specific antigen, a Helper T-cell releases chemicals that tell that B-cell to divide many times. This makes an army of B-cells with the perfectly shaped B-cell receptor to connect to the invader in your body. Many of these B-cells quickly turn into Plasma cells. show/hide words to know. 1  Antibody: a molecule made by B-cells to trap foreign particles and microbes... 2  Molecule: a chemical structure that has two or more atoms held together by a chemical bond. 3  Plasma cell: an immune cell that comes from B-cells and makes and releases antibodies. 4  Receptor: a molecule on the surface of a cell that receives ...Membrane-bound Immunoglobulins. Membrane-bound immunoglobulins are associated non-covalently with two accessory peptides forming the B-cell antigen receptor complex. The first antigen receptors expressed by B cells are IgM and IgD. The receptor is a prototype of the antibody that the B cell is prepared to produce. The B cell receptor (BCR) can only bind antigens. It is the heterodimer of Ig alpha and Ig beta that enables the cell to transduce the signal and respond to the presence of antigens on the cell surface. The signal generated causes the growth and proliferation of the B cell and antibody production inside the plasma cell
what food or vitamin is good for cortisol	Cortisol Reducing Foods Photo Credit Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images. Cortisol is a stress hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Overproduction of cortisol can have dangerous implications for overall health and wellness. Certain foods and dietary strategies are known to lower cortisol production. High-quality sources of protein can help to decrease cortisol production. Whey protein, eggs and lean animal meats contain amino acids that are essential to survival. By taking in 15 to 30 grams of protein every two to three hours, we can drastically blunt cortisol production.Vitamin C. This antioxidant vitamin has been shown to help reduce cortisol post exercise. One study showed that providing physically active individuals 800 mg of Vitamin C for 6-weeks prior to a 90-minute high-intensity interval running program had lower cortisol levels post-workout than the placebo group! Not to mention the individuals supplementing with Vitamin C cleared cortisol more quickly with significantly lower cortisol after 1 hour of recovery. There are other studies to support vitamin C’s effectiveness for reducing cortisol by diminishing oxidative indicators produced when cortisol is elevated. Most studies support the use of higher doses of vitamin C to help control cortisol. Consider using anywhere from 500mg to 1000mg.
autosomal recessive genetic disorder list	Inheritance of Autosomal Recessive Genetic Diseases. These genetic diseases are diseases caused by an error in a single DNA gene. Autosomal means the errors occurs on chromosome 1..22 rather than on the 23rd sex-linked X chromosome. Recessive means that disease only occurs when a person has two copies of the bad gene. Usually this means they must inherit the disease from both parents. Some examples of autosomal recessive diseases are Cystic Fibrosis, Phenylketonuria, Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay Sachs, Albinism, and galactosemia. See autosomal recessive diseases for a full list. Recessive diseases often occur in genes that produce an enzyme. In a carrier, who has only one bad copy, there is often no disease, because the second gene can pull up the slack, and maintain health. In some recessive diseases, a carrier gets a mild form of the diseas3.3 Autosomal Recessive Inheritance. In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of a disease allele are required for an individual to be susceptible to expressing the phenotype. Typically, the parents of an affected individual are not affected but are gene carriers. As in autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of a disease allele on the X chromosome are required for an individual with two X chromosomes (a female) to be affected with an X-linked recessive disease.
main function of ribosomes	Related Information: They do this by translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins. Messenger RNA is simply a copy of the DNA from the nucleus that is allowed to enter the cytoplasm and be used to make proteins. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis, where RNA is translated into protein. When cells need large numbers of proteins, they must first build numerous ribosomes. Because protein synthesis is so important to cells, there are large numbers of ribosomes in all cells, often numbering in the hundreds or thousands. Ribosomes are used in the synthesis of proteins and enzymes required by the cells for various purposes. Most of our cellular chemical reactions are enhanced (catalyzed) by enzymes, in order for the cells to function properly. Ribosomes make proteins for use in the cell and for export.The primary function of Ribosomes is to read and translate the cell's genetic code, then reproduce (replicate) the proteins that the code represents. Without the ribosomes this coded message could not be read or replicated. Ribosomes are used in the synthesis of proteins and enzymes required by the cells for various purposes. Most of our cellular chemical reactions are enhanced (catalyzed) by enzymes, in order for the cells to function properly. Ribosomes make proteins for use in the cell and for export.
what stimulates a muscle cell to contract	Types of Muscle Tissue. Skeletal muscle is associated with the bony skeleton, and consists of large cells that bear striations and are controlled voluntarily. Cardiac muscle occurs only in the heart, and consists of small cells that are striated and under involuntary control. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs, and consists of small elongated cells that are not striated and are under involuntary control. Special Characteristics of Muscle Tissue. Excitability, or irritability, is the ability to receive and respond to a stimulusNeuromuscular Junction Skeletal muscle cells contract as a result of impulses from motor neurons. The place where a motor neuron stimulates a muscle cell is called a neuromuscular junction. In order for skeletal muscle cells to contract each cell must be stimulated by a process of a motor neuron. Sliding Filament Theory The theory of how muscle contracts is the sliding filament theory. The contraction of a muscle occurs as the thin filament slide past the thick filaments. In skeletal muscle, the cells never contract individually. Rather they contract as groups of muscle cells that are collectively connected to a motor nerve originating in the spinal cord. The combination of the motor nerve cell (neuron) and the muscle cells it innervates is known as the motor unit.
lab on enzyme activity with beef catalase	You will now test for the presence of catalase in tissues other than liver. Place 2 ml of hydrogen peroxide in each of 3 clean test tubes and then add each of the three test substances to the tubes. To the first tube, add a small piece of potato. If the cells did not break down the hydrogen peroxide, they would be poisoned and die. In this lab, you will study the catalase found in liver cells. You will be using chicken or beef liver. It might seem strange to use dead cells to study the function of enzymes. This is possible because when a cell dies, the enzymes remain intact and active for several weeks, as long as the tissue is kept refrigeratedIn this lab, you will study an enzyme that is found in the cells of many living tissues. The name of the enzyme is catalase (KAT-uh-LAYSS); it speeds up a reaction which breaks down hydrogen peroxide, a toxic chemical, into 2 harmless substances--water and oxygen.

what kind of bears are in india	Like all other animals, the origin of bears is also from the Northern Hemisphere. In India three species of bears are found, The Himalayan Black Bear, The Brown Bear and The Sloth Bear. Bears can easily be recognized by their heavy body, thick coat of hair, protruding lips and lumbering gait. Bear’s have very good sense of smell which in a way overcomes the handicap of poor hearing and sight. Himalayan Black Bear is a large yet compact of all three bear species found in India. It can reach a length of 5-6 ft and when standing it can be a formidable sight and foe to tackle with. It has a smooth black shining coat than the sloth bear and has a distinct V shaped mark on the breasAsian black bears are black and have a light brown muzzle. They are white on the chin, and have a distinct white patch on the chest, which sometimes has the shape of a V. Their ears are bell shaped, proportionately longer than those of other bears, and stick out sideways from the head. The tail is 11 cm (4.3 in) long. The famed British sportsman known as the Old Shekarry wrote of how a black bear he shot in India probably weighed no less than 363 kg (800 lb) based on how many people it took to lift its body. The largest Asian black bear on record allegedly weighed 200 kg (440 lb). Zoo-kept specimens can weigh up to 225 kg (496 lb).

how long it takes to get pregnant after stopping the pill	Menstrual bleeding usually results from a decrease in natural hormone levels about 14 days after the ovulation, if you're not pregnant. The average woman takes one month to three months to start ovulating again after stopping the pill. Sometimes ovulation may occur sooner; other times, it may take longer. So the first sign that your ovulation has returned is usually the reappearance of your regular menstrual cycle, a couple of weeks after ovulation. Without ovulating you cannot get pregnant. So if you are on the birth control pill, the first step in trying to get pregnant is to stop the pill. Preferably, if you want to get pregnant and you have been on the pill, you wait until the end of the birth control pill pack and then just don't start with the new pack.Found This Helpful. The length of time needed to get pregnant after stopping birth control pills depends on how long it takes for a woman to start ovulating again. For some women, this may happen in as little as two weeks; others may need several months. Benefit of Waiting. While it may be possible for you to get pregnant very soon after stopping the pill, waiting until you have at least one normal period will help you and your doctor estimate the date of conception and your baby's due date, useful information for monitoring the fetus's development.

how to heal belly and kidneys with food	Fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, which promote kidney and liver health. Your kidneys and liver are responsible for a variety of functions, but both organs work as as filters that remove toxins and waste products from your body. Diets high in preservatives, chemicals, toxins, refined sugar, hydrogenated fats or protein can damage your kidneys and liver, leading to dysfunction and disease. Produce rich in these potent nutrients include citrus fruits, most berries, dark-colored grapes, apples, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, spinach and asparagus, the “American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide” notes. Vitamin C also helps to dissolve calcium buildup in the kidneys.Kidney stones can develop when minerals build up in your urine. However, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and low in salt or oxalate-rich food can help prevent mineral build up. Additionally, drinking lots of water throughout the day, especially if you exercise frequently, is important for kidney health. Staying hydrated is necessary for prevention and treatment. Keeping your urine diluted is important for keeping your kidneys healthy. Water is the best choice, but you can also drink fruit juices, ginger ale or tea. If your urine is light colored after you go to the bathroom, you are getting enough fluid.
what is glucose? formal definition	Glucose is the primary energy source for the body's cells and the only energy source for the brain and nervous system. A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood. A few different protocols may be used to evaluate the glucose level in the blood. There are a few different conditions that may disrupt the balance between glucose and the pancreatic hormones, resulting in high or low blood glucose. The most common cause is diabetes. Diabetes is a group of disorders associated with insufficient insulin production and/or a resistance to the effects of insulin.Glucagon. A hormone produced by the pancreas that increases the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Insulin. A hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. The beta cells of the pancreas make insulin. When the body cannot make enough insulin, insulin is taken by injection or other means. Insulin Resistance. The body's inability to respond to and use the insulin it produces. Blood Glucose. The main sugar found in the blood and the body's main source of energy. Also called blood sugar. Blood Glucose Montoring. Checking blood glucose levels by using a blood glucose meter or blood glucose test strips that change color when touched by a blood sample in order to manage diabetes.
what types of bears are in pennsylvania	Black Bears. Black bears are the smallest and most common of the three bear species found in North America, and the only species found in Pennsylvania. This fact sheet covers general black bear biology, damage caused by black bears, and damage control strategies. Black bears are the smallest and most common of the three bear species found in North America, and the only species found in Pennsylvania. Their fur is generally uniform in color but is not necessarily black. In Pennsylvania, bear habitat typically consists of mixed hardwood forests. Oak, hickory, black cherry, and beech trees provide the favorite mast of the black bear. An understory of blackberries and blueberries attracts bears; cornfields and abandoned apple orchards also are popular feeding sites.It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. Black bears are omnivores with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food. Along with the brown bear, it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered globally threatened with extinction by the IUCN. American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears, a behavior common to many species of bears.
why does my muscles twitch	However, involuntary muscle twitches are not all fasciculations, and any non-fasciculation muscle twitch is almost certainly a bad sign. Fibrillation, for example, can be confused with fasciculation, but fibrillation indicates that the surrounding muscle fibers have completely lost their nerve supply. Of course, it's not that easy to tell if you have a magnesium deficiency; the effects are mostly vague, stuff like hyperexcitability, muscle weakness, and sleepiness, as well as, um, fasciculations. So make sure to eat high-magnesium foods like leafy greens, nuts, and wheat bran.Muscle twitching, also known as muscle fasciculation, is marked by small muscle contractions in the body. Your muscles are composed of fibers, tissues, and nerves. When a nerve is stimulated or damaged, it may cause your muscle fibers to twitch. Many twitches experienced in your body are common and may go unnoticed. However, other types of twitching may be a sign of a nervous system condition and should be checked out by your doctor. This condition is fairly common, and symptoms usually go away after a couple of days. There are also less common and more serious causes of muscle twitching. These medical conditions and illnesses are often related to your nervous system. They may damage the nerves connected to your muscles, leading to
what contains neurons that branch throughout the body	The ventral root contains efferent (motor) fibers that carry messages from the spinal cord to the effectors. Cell bodies of the efferent fibers reside in the spinal cord gray matter. These roots become nerves that innervate (transmit nerve impulses to) muscles and organs throughout the body. The perikaryon (cell body) is the neuron central part. Dendrites, short branches, extend from the neuron. These input channels receive information from other neurons or sensory cells (cells that receive information from the environment). A long branch, the axon, extends from the neuron as its output channelThe nervous system can be divided into two parts: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system consists of sensory and motor nervous cells that run throughout the rest of the body. Neurons are responsible for sending, receiving, and interpreting information from all parts of the body. A neuron consists of two major parts: Axons and dendrites are bundled together into what are called nerves. These nerves send signals between the brain, spinal cord, and other body organs via nerve impulses. Nerve impulses are received at the neuronal dendrites and are carried along the axon to the terminal branches.
what are wolves	Wolves are large, predatory canids once common throughout North America, Europe, Africa and Asia, now living mostly in remote wilderness. They are the largest living members of the canid family, which also includes foxes and coyotes. Wolves are the ancestors of all domestic dogs. There are two species of wolves in North America. The smaller species is the red wolf, Canis rufus, which has shorter, redder fur than the gray wolf. The gray wolf, Canis lupus, has thicker fur which is more gray or golden, and is larger than the red wolf. Since many of these animals are larger than wolves, the only way wolves can catch them is to live and hunt in groups. Wolves will also catch and eat rabbits, mice, birds, snakes, fish and other animals. Wolves will eat non-meat items (such as vegetables), but not often.Wolves are common to all parts of the Northern Hemisphere. They are usually shy and cautious around humans but unlike the dog, have not been domesticated at all. The most common type of wolf is the gray wolf, or timber wolf. Adult grey wolves are 4 to 6.56 feet (120 to 200centimeters) long and weigh about 40 to 175 pounds (18 to 79 kilograms). Just like its name, the gray wolf typically has thick gray fur, although pure white or all black variations exist. Another common species, the red wolf, is a bit smaller.

which two colonies which were proprietary colonies.	The Province of New Jersey was one of the Middle Colonies of Colonial America and became the U.S. state of New Jersey in 1776. The province had originally been settled by Europeans as part of New Netherland, but came under English rule after the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, becoming a proprietary colony. On April 17, 1702, under the rule of Queen Anne, the two sections of the proprietary colony were united and New Jersey became a royal colony. Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. However, he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land.Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore was the first Proprietor and Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland. A proprietary colony was a type of British colony especially in North America and the Caribbean in the 17th century. In the British Empire, all land belonged to the king, and it was his prerogative to divide. Therefore all colonial properties were partitioned by royal charter into one of four types: proprietary, royal, joint stock, or covenant. 1 Province of Georgia. 2  Province of Carolina (which was divided in 1712 into the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina. 3  Province of Pennsylvania (aka Pennsylvania Colony)-Granted to William Penn in 1681.
which accounting concept does the direct write-off method violate?	Thus the use of direct write-off method would cause deduction of expenses of previous period against revenue of current period which is contrary to the matching principle of accounting. Since this method is not according to GAAP, it not advised to use direct write-off method. Instead, the allowance method of bad debts treatment is preferred.The Disadvantages of Direct Write-off Method. Allowing customers to pay within a reasonable time of purchasing a product or service makes the purchasing process smoother and increases total sales. Unfortunately, not all customers pay their debts in full. When a customer refuses to pay, a business may sell the account to a collections agency or stop attempting to collect on the debt entirely. Either way, the business suffers a loss on the sale and has to account for it. The direct write-off method expenses the entire loss when it occurs. Non-GAAP While only publicly traded companies are required to file financial statements prepared following the generally accepted accounting principles of the United States, the direct write-off method violates the GAAP. The GAAP prohibits direct write-off because it doesn’t conform to the matching principle, which requires that every transaction affecting one account, such as inventory, be matched with another account, such as cash.
which are the ionian islands	Scattered along the western coastline of Central Greece, the Ionian Islands as they are known, are an island cluster comprising twelve small and large islands whose total surface area comes to 2,200 square kilometers. Zakynthos, Ithaca, Corfu (Kerkyra), Kefalonia, Lefkada, and Paxi are the six, large Ionian Islands. Antipaxi, Erikousa, Mathraki, Othoni, Meganisi and the deserted islets of Strofades south of Zakynthos are the smaller Ionian Islands. The Ionian Islands were part of the Byzantine Empire until1204 when the Franks took over Constantinople and the Ionian Islands were eventually ceded to the Venetians. Under Venetian rule, the Ionian Islands formed their own local nobility whose register survived as late as the 19 th century.The six northern islands are off the west coast of Greece, in the Ionian Sea. The seventh island, Kythira, is off the southern tip of the Peloponnese, the southern part of the Greek mainland. Kythira is not part of the region of the Ionian Islands, as it is included in the region of Attica. [ioˈnia]). In English, the adjective relating to Ionia is Ionic, not Ionian. The islands themselves are known by a rather confusing variety of names. During the centuries of rule by Venice, they acquired Venetian names, by which some of them are still known in English (and in Italian).
identify the differences between bacteria viruses fungi and parasites	Viruses are not considered living because they are unable to reproduce. Bacteria is a single celled organism and, unlike viruses, do not need a living host to reproduce. Fungi are multi-cellular organisms and parasites are any vectors that require a living host in order to live/reproduce.All that I know off the top of my head.acteria are prokaryotes. Fungi are eukaryotes. They are plenty of differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Some of these are: prokaryotes have a single circular chromosomes while eukaryotes have multiple linear chromosomes.Identify the differences between bacteria viruses, Fungi and Parasites. Viruses are pieces of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) wrapped in a thin coat of protein that replicate only within the cells of living hosts.Bacteria are one-cell microorganisms with a simple cellular organization whose nucleus lacks a membrane.Parasites may be protozoa, yeasts, or multicellular organisms such as fungi or worms that live in or on a host to obtain nourishment without providing any benefit to the host.acteria are one-cell microorganisms with a simple cellular organization whose nucleus lacks a membrane.

linux how to change directory	The directory you are standing in is called the working directory. To find the name of the working directory, use the. command. When you first log on to a Linux system, the working directory is set to your home directory. This is where you put your files. (change directory), and. (list files and directories). If you have not worked with a command line interface before, you will need to pay close attention to this lesson, since the concepts will take some getting used to.To change directories while in a *nix environment, use the cd command. Below are some basic examples of how this command can be used to change directories. Before changing directories, you need to know what directories are available in the current directory. To do this, use the ls command. For example, type the below command to only list directories in the current directory. ls-d */. See the ls command page for further information and examples of this command. Once you know the directory is available, type a command similar to the below command. For example, type the below command to only list directories in the current directory. dir /ad. See the dir command page for further information and examples of this command. In the picture is an example of the tree command that list all directories and subdirectories from your current location.
how to calculate your rate per hour	1 Income / Hours = Hourly Rate. 2  Example: $15,000 / 2114 = $7.10 per hour. 3  You can check your results against this salary converter, which also allows you to correct for several different variables. You can figure out your hourly rate based on an annual income, for a more accurate figure, or you find your hourly rate for a specific job or time period. 1  For example, if you get paid by the job or project, you may just want to keep track of the hours for that project to determine your hourly rate for that job.$294,427.00 / 3844.2 hours = $76.59 cost per hour to run the business. At this point you now know that the True Cost of running your business is $76.59 per hour. Calculate your hourly charge out rate: The hourly charge out rate will be the cost per hour multiplied by the target profit percentage. $76.59 per hour X 25% = $95.74 per hour charge rate. What you charge out per hour is up to you, the key here, is that you clearly understand how much it truly cost you per revenue generating hour to run your business. Once you have calculated the true cost of running your business per hour, you can then add your profit margin to the hourly rate. The Calculation: If each of your service technicians work a 37.5 hour week, 7.5 hr day, the calculation is; 37.5 hours X 52 weeks = 1950 hrs paid for per year
what gases are good insulators	A good dielectric gas should have high dielectric strength, high thermal stability and chemical inertness against the construction materials used, non-flammability and low toxicity, low boiling point, good heat transfer properties, and low cost. The most common dielectric gas is air, due to its ubiquity and low cost. Another commonly used gas is a dry nitrogen. In special cases, e.g., high voltage switches, gases with good dielectric properties and very high breakdown voltages are needed. Highly electronegative elements, e.g., halogens, are favored as they rapidly recombine with the ions present in the discharge channel. The halogen gases are highly corrosiveGases with electronegative species (i.e. halogens such as chlorine) make good insulators, hence the popularity of SF6, which is not only dense (breakdown voltage is roughly proportional to density) but is mostly Fluorine, a highly electronegative element. Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) - Sulfur Hexafluoride is probably the most popular insulating gas, although its cost has risen dramatically recently. Hydrogen-Hydrogen gas is not a particularly good insulator (65% of air) from a breakdown voltage standpoint. Its very low viscosity and high thermal capacity make it an insulating gas of choice for high speed, high voltage machinery such as turbogenerators

Lymph is a fluid similar in composition to blood plasma. It is derived from blood plasma as fluids pass through capillary walls at the arterial end. As the interstitial fluid begins to accumulate, it is picked up and removed by tiny lymphatic vessels and returned to the blood.
what was the first continental congress and why was it significant	The Continental Congress was a convention of delegates called together from the Thirteen Colonies which became the governing body of the United States (USA) during the American Revolution. The Congress met from 1774 to 1789 in three incarnations. The first call for a convention was made over issues of the blockade and the Intolerable Acts penalizing the Province of Massachusetts, which in 1774 enabled Benjamin Franklin to convince the colonies to form a representative body. The Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, 1775, at Philadelphia's State House, unanimously passing the Declaration of Independence the following year on July 2, 1776, and publicly announcing the decision two days later.On September 5, 1774, delegates from each of the 13 colonies except for Georgia (which was fighting a Native-American uprising and was dependent on the British for military supplies) met in Philadelphia as the First Continental Congress to organize colonial resistance to Parliament’s Coercive Acts. Should Britain fail to redress the colonists’ grievances in a timely manner, the Congress declared, then it would reconvene on May 10, 1775, and the colonies would cease to export goods to Britain on September 10, 1775. After proclaiming these measures, the First Continental Congress disbanded on October 26, 1774.

average salary auckland	According to the data, people in the Wellington region command the largest salary package at almost $6000 above the national average. The average salary in the capital rose 1.9 percent to $80,934. Auckland was second in the top five highest-paid regions with the average salary growing 2.3 percent to $76,338. Canterbury came in third, growing 2.6 percent to $72,512. The fourth on the list was Taranaki, though the data showed the average salary there had actually dropped 8.5 percent to $72,376. The salary for this sector grew 2 percent in the year to $99,046. Engineering was next at $92,479, growing 2 percent; construction was third at $92,479 also growing 2 percent; while the average yearly salary grew 1 percent to $92,082.Auckland was the only region where house price growth outstripped salaries. The bog-standard Auckland home has added $83,000 in value since March 2014 - a 13 per cent jump to a median selling price of $720,000. Latest available Statistics NZ figures show the price growth eclipsed what most people earned in their jobs. The average Auckland home earned nearly $230 a day in the past year-about twice what the average worker made in their job. It means the typical Auckland property earned about the same as an entry-level doctor or head of department teacher with responsibility for 10 staff
average salaries in spain	Spaniards earn USD 34 824 per year on average, less than the OECD average of USD 36 118. Not everyone earns that amount however. In all OECD countries, men still earn more than women, with an average wage gap of 15.5%. In Spain, men earn 8.6% more than women. Also, whereas the top 20% of the population earn an estimated USD 45 977 per year, the bottom 20% live on an estimated USD 22 010 per year. Household financial wealth is the total value of a household’s financial worth, such as money or shares held in bank accounts. In Spain, the average household net financial wealth per capita is estimated at USD 24 774, lower than the OECD average of USD 67 139.The countries in purple on the map have net average monthly salaries in excess of € 3000, in blue – in the range of €2000–€3000, in green – in the range of €1000–€2000, in olive – in the range of €700–€1000, in yellow – in the range of €500–€700, in orange – in the range of €250–€500, in red below €250. €351.

authoritative name server definition	in whatis. Resolving name servers are very useful for dialup, cable modem, ADSL, DSL, VPN and similar users. A resolving name servers is provided by your ISP (internet service provider) or your organizations network admin or third party resolving name servers. Resolving name servers directly finds out information about the root servers, top level domains and authoritative name servers. It also speed up queries by caching results locallly as configured by hostmater in their domains’ TTL field. Name servers in delegations appear listed by name, rather than by IP address. A resolving name server must issue another DNS request to find out the IP address of the server to which it has been referred. Since this can introduce a circular dependency if the nameserver referred to is under the domain that it is authoritative of, it is occasionally necessary for the nameserver providing the delegation to also provide the IP address of the next nameserver. This record is called a glue record.Authoritative answer. A name server indicates that its response is authoritative by setting the Authoritative Answer (AA) bit in the response to a query on a name for which it is authoritative. Name servers providing answers for which they are not authoritative (for example, name servers for parent zones) do not set the AA bit.
what is a feldspar in ceramics	The most common fluxes used in clay bodies are potassium oxide and sodium oxide which are found in feldspars. A predominant flux in glazes is calcium oxide which is usually obtained from limestone. The two most common feldspars in the ceramic industry are potash feldspar (orthoclase) and soda feldspar (albite). The most commonly used fluxing oxides in a ceramic glaze contain lead, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, barium, zinc, strontium, and manganese. These are introduced to the raw glaze as compounds, for example lead as lead oxide. Boron is considered by many to be a glass former rather than a flux.Most of the names are trade names, with the exceptions of lepidolite, petalite, and spodumene, which are true mineral names. Nepheline syenite is actually a rock composed of potash and soda feldspars plus the mineral nepheline (a sodium aluminum silicate). In the table, the trade names for the feldspars are grouped according to the actual type of feldspar that they contain. The analyses will allow you to compare the compositions of different raw materials when it is desirable to make substitutions in clay body and glaze recipes. The weight percent values will be useful in the conversion of glaze recipes from Seger molecular formulas to weight percent recipes when using these raw materials.

how many different languages are there	The object of inquiry in linguistics is human language, in particular the extent and limits of diversity in the world’s languages. One might suppose, therefore, that linguists would have a clear and reasonably precise notion of how many languages there are in the world. It turns out, however, that there is no such definite count—or at least, no such count that has any status as a scientific finding of modern linguistics. More than you might have thought! When people are asked how many languages they think there are in the world, the answers vary quite a bit. One random sampling of New Yorkers, for instance, resulted in answers like “probably several hundred.” However we choose to count them, though, this is not close.Linguists estimate that there are about 6,000-7,000 different languages spoken in the world today. The imprecision in this estimate is largely due to the fact that some dialects are in the process of diverging and it is not clear that they have reached the stage of being separate languages. In reality, the distribution of languages globally is very complex and difficult to easily describe. Numerous migrations of people over the last several centuries have resulted in most large nations now having many different languages. There are at least 165 languages spoken in the United States today.
cost to maintain vgo	The cost of the VGo is also steep at approximately $6,000 to $7,000. There’s also an additional annual service contract that costs approximately $100 a month and additional charging pads cost about $500. The user can also upgrade the battery to a 12-hour model for an additional $200. Earlier this year, a group of teenagers in Utah helped raise money to purchase a VGo robot for the Primary Children’s Medical Center located in Salt Lake City. To stay charged, the VGo must return to a charging pad while it’s not in use as the standard model has a 6-hour battery life. The user connects to the VGo through an application that’s available for both Macs and PCs. The VGo could also be extremely useful in the medical field or general business.1 The price varies depending upon the features, brand and size of the pump. 2  For example, the Accu-Chek Spirit Insulin Pump costs about $4,600 and includes only a few a features, such as software that allows readings to be downloaded to a personal digital assistant (PDA). 1 The Minimed Paradigm 522 is more expensive, retailing at about $5,200, but includes more features, like continuous glucose monitoring. 2  Some insurance plans will cover the cost of the pump. 3  Patients with insurance can expect typical copay and coinsurance rates ranging from $5 to half of the total

exempt salary minimum	Most California employers are well aware that California’s minimum wage for non-exempt employees will increase from $8 per hour to $9 per hour on July 1, 2014, and to $10 per hour on January 1, 2016. California law requires that in order to be classified as exempt, an employee must earn a monthly salary which is twice the state minimum for a full time employee (40 hours per week). Currently the minimum salary for a full time, exempt employee is $33,280 per year. This will increase on July 1, 2014 to a minimum exempt salary of $37,440 per year. By 2016, employees will need to earn at least $41,600 per year to meet the minimum salary test for exempt status. State minimum wage law will also impact the pay of commissioned inside sales employeesAn employee who fits this exemption may be paid either a salary of at least $455 per week, or on an hourly basis with no premium for overtime work, i.e., straight-time pay for all hours worked, as long as the hourly rate is at least $27.63 per hour. Return to Businesses & Employers. Return to TWC Home. However, if in addition to the salary, the exempt employee receives additional pay such as a commission or bonus, such additional pay can be docked, consistent with a written wage deduction authorization agreement-see DOL opinion letters FLSA2006-24 and FLSA2006-24NA.

where is information contained in the dna	In other cases, the RNA molecule carries messages from the DNA to other parts of the cell for processing. Most often, this information is used to manufacture proteins. The specific type of RNA that carries the information stored in DNA to other areas of the cell is called messenger RNA, or mRNA. Transcription begins when an enzyme called RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA template strand and begins assembling a new chain of nucleotides to produce a complementary RNA strand. During translation, the information that is contained within the mRNA is used to direct the creation of a protein molecule. In order for this to occur, however, the mRNA itself must be read by a special, protein-synthesizing structure within the cell known as a ribosome.­DNA carr­ies all of the information for your physical characteristics, which are essentially determined by proteins. So, DNA contains the instructions for making a protein. In DNA, each protein is encoded by a gene (a specific sequence of DNA nucleotides that specify how a single protein is to be made). The particular sequence of amino acids in the chain is what makes one protein different from another. This sequence is encoded in the DNA where one gene encodes for one protein. The genetic code consists of 3-base words or codons that specify particular amino acids.

how much does a horse trainer get paid of the winnings	Jockeys are paid on a per mount (race) basis. The fees are between $30 per mount and $100 per mount depending on the purse structure at each particular track. Those are the fees jockeys receive if they do not finish first, second or third. The jockey of the winning horse receives an amount equal to 10% of the winning owner' s share of the total purse. So, in a race where the total purse is $50000, the winning horse receives 60% of that purse ($30000). The winning rider would then get 10% ($3000). Source(s): 42 years experience in the officiating/training of thoroughbred race horses!It is typical/customary for a public trainer to get 10% of the purse monies won by the horses he trains. In a race with a purse of $1 million, the winner typically gets about $600,000, so the trainer will get $60,000. There may be other contractual arrangements between the owner and the trainer. Shug McGaughey, for example, is a private trainer for the Phipps, Claiborne Farm, and a few other selected patrons. So for a $1,000,000 race the winning horse might recieve $550,000-750,000, 10% of which would be $55,000-75,000. Many trainers split this amount with their stable help. Some give 1% of purse money to the groom & exercise rider, others bank all of their purse money and distribute percentages throughout the stable yard.
correct temperature for chest freezer	The correct freezer temperature can vary according the local inspecting authority. The United States Food and Drug Administration does not set a specific temperature. They require that the food be frozen solid. Most things that do not have high sugar content are frozen solid at about 20 degrees Fahrenheit. If the air can not circulate freely in the box, there may be warm spots. For example, putting a baking sheet on a shelf in a reach-in blocks the air flow and the food below the sheet may not freeze solid. The FDA allows four to six hours for food put in the freezer to be cooled to the proper freezer temperature. Most freezers are designed to maintain the temperature of cold food. Too much warm food can increase the box temperature and even cause other food to warmFreezer Upright and Chest Temperatures. The correct operating temperature of chest and upright freezers, including smaller, compact models is -5 to +5 degrees Fahrenheit. In order to take the temperature of solid food, place a thermometer between frozen packages or in some ice cream. Your chest freezer has a test position on the temperature monitor control. In order to verify that the buzzer is working, just put the switch in the test position and turn the thermostat to the coldest setting. The buzzer should go off within 10 to 15 seconds.

solar cost decline	Among utility-scale projects completed in 2013, installed prices ranged from $1.9/W to $4.9/W, with most projects falling within a narrower range from $2.6/W to $3.5/W (the 20th and 80th percentiles, respectively), and similar or greater levels of variability in prior years. The Alamosa Solar Generating Project, located on 225 acres in the San Luis Valley near Alamosa, Colorado, is the largest high-concentrating solar photovoltaic power generation system in the world. It consists of more than 500 dual-axis, pedestal-mounted tracker assemblies, each producing 60 kilowatts.Report: US solar costs continue rapid decline. System costs have declined by a total of 85-95% since peaking a decade ago. Solar prices in the US in 2013 fell by a further 15% year on year, a study from the Department of Energy and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has found. The report ‘Tracking the Sun’ is the seventh edition summarising PV prices from 1998, up to the first half of 2014, across the US. The study concluded that between 2012 and 2013 solar prices fell by 12-15% depending on system size, averaging US$0.07 per year. The report surveyed 300,000 residential, commercial and utility-scale solar systems, across 33 states, representing 80% of grid connected solar in the US and looks at the dollar cost per watt for solar.
what company makes fluoxetine	Fluoxetine (also known by the trade names Prozac, and Sarafem, among others) is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class.

what is a microgram compared to a gram	One mg is equal to 1000 micrograms. This means that a milligram is 1000 times bigger than a microgram. Also, a milligram is a thousandth smaller than a gram. The milligram is the more frequently used unit of measurement due to its bigger size. The term “mg” stands for the measurement of “milligrams” while “mcg” stands for “micrograms.” Both units are used to measure an object’s mass and to indicate an object’s weight. With reference to other units of measurement, an mcg is equal to .001 mg. It implies that the microgram is smaller compared to a milligram. Compared to a gram, a microgram is a millionth smaller. The microgram is one of the smallest units and is frequently used in microbiology tests specifically in measurements for antibiotics like penicillin, oxacillin and others. A microgram is expressed as (μg) in usagConvert from mcg to mg. Convert between micrograms (mcg) and milligrams (mg) using this simple tool.

what is iodine used for	Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53. The name is from Greek ἰοειδής ioeidēs, meaning violet or purple, due to the color of elemental iodine vapor. Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition, and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers. Iodine's relatively high atomic number, low toxicity, and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine. Iodine-131 (usually in the chemical form of iodide) is a component of nuclear fallout, and is particularly dangerous owing to the thyroid gland's propensity to concentrate ingested iodine, where it is kept for periods longer than this isotope's radiological half-life of eight days.5. A nascent iodine solution can be used to assist the body in fighting off harmful organisms. Using an iodine tonic as a throat gargle is also helpful for a cough. Iodine also acts as an expectorant of mucous from the common cold and other respiratory ailments. 1. Radiation Exposure. Potassium iodine has been used to help individuals exposed to radiation by reducing the harmful accumulation of radioactive substances in the thyroid. However, It has been said that nascent Iodine may be 4-7 times more effective than potassium iodide and is much safer to use.
How long does it take to boil an egg	The length of time it takes to hard boil an egg depends on the size and type of the egg. First, put eggs in a pan and fill with enough cold water to cover eggs completely, then bring water to a rapid boil.As soon as the water reaches a rapid boil, remove pan from heat and cover egg pan tightly with a lid. Let sit 12 minutes for regular-sized eggs, 17 minutes for large eggs and 20 minutes for jumbo eggs.Transfer eggs immediately to cold water and let cool at least 10 minutes.s soon as the water reaches a rapid boil, remove pan from heat and cover egg pan tightly with a lid. Let sit 12 minutes for regular-sized eggs, 17 minutes for large eggs and 20 minutes for jumbo eggs. Transfer eggs immediately to cold water and let cool at least 10 minutes.Depending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly in 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more.eat the pot on high heat and bring the water to a full rolling boil. Adding a teaspoon of vinegar to the water may help keep egg whites from running out if an egg does crack while cooking. Also some people find adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the water helps prevent cracking as well as making the eggs easier to peel.
what system controls muscles and regulates body activities	Graphics illustrate how the body has two main systems for coordinating and regulating its activities: the nervous system and the endocrine system. The video introduces endocrine glands and the hormones they secrete. It describes how hormones are chemical messengers that communicate with different parts of the body. - explain the role of hormones in regulating metabolism, growth, and other body processes. - explain how the nervous and endocrine systems interact. - describe the role of the brain's hypothalamus in main taining the right levels of hormones in the body.Functions of the Endocrine System. The Endocrine system (along with the nervous system) controls and regulates the complex activities of the body. The Endocrine system regulates the activities of the body by secreting complex chemical substances (hormones) into the blood stream. These secretions come from a variety of glands which control various organs of the body. The key functions are: 1  To regulate the metabolic functions of the body. Hormones. are secreted from the glands of the endocrine system, they are specific in that each hormone causes a response in a specific target organ or group of cells, rather than on the body as a whole. Exocrine hormones are secreted via a duct into the blood and usually effect a distant organ or tissue.

That figure is slightly less than CBO’s estimate of the average annual cost of the Navy’s 2014 plan. CBO’s estimate of the cost of new-ship construction in the Navy’s 2015 shipbuilding plan is $66 billion, or 13 percent, higher over the next 30 years than the Navy’s estimate. Report. CBO estimates that the cost of the Navy’s 2015 shipbuilding plan—an average of about $21 billion per year (adjusted for inflation) over 30 years—would be one-third higher than the funding that the Navy has received in recent decades.
what is griefing	You can help by expanding it. This article is a stub. You can help by expanding it. Griefing is the act of irritating and angering players (usually on multiplayer servers) using methods such as destruction, social engineering and trolling. Examples of griefing include: destruction of structures owned by other players; stealing other players items; and repeated killing of less well equipped players. A more time-consuming and generally expensive method of griefing is creation of TNT cannons to bombard other players' creations from a safe distance. In very rare cases, they will cut out a fairly large chunk of your house, usually in a square, and fill it with water, to make it harder for you to re-build it.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. (Redirected from Griefing). For a Wikipedia essay on the topic, see Wikipedia:Griefing. A griefer is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game, using aspects of the game in unintended ways. Griefing is doing stuff to cause grief/inconvenience/etc to other players. Trolling isn't always as bad. It's just doing/saying things to provoke a reaction, often an angry one.

planet opposite orbit	The terms orbital period, periapsis, and apoapsis were introduced in Chapter 3. , in which the spacecraft moves in the same direction as the planet rotates, or. , going in a direction opposite the planet's rotation. is a term used to describe the locations of various points in an orbit. It is the angular distance of a point in an orbit past the point of periapsis, measured in degrees. For example, a spacecraft might cross a planet's equator at 10° true anomaly. All eight planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in the direction that the Sun is rotating, which is counterclockwise when viewed from above the Sun's north pole. Six of the planets also rotate about their axis in this same direction. The exceptions—the planets with retrograde rotation—are Venus and Uranus. Venus's axial tilt is 177 degrees, which means it is spinning almost exactly in the opposite direction to its orbit. Uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77 degrees, so its axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System. The inclination of a celestial object is the angle between its orbital plane and another reference frame such as the equatorial plane of the object's primary. In the Solar System, inclination of the planets is measured from the ecliptic plane, which is the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun.

how did the northern renaissance start	The Northern Renaissance was the Renaissance that occurred in Europe north of the Alps. Before 1497, Italian Renaissance humanism had little influence outside Italy. From the late 15th century, its ideas spread around Europe. This influenced the German Renaissance, French Renaissance, English Renaissance, Renaissance in the Low Countries, Polish Renaissance and other national and localized movements, each with different characteristics and strengths. The Renaissance was brought to Poland directly from Italy by artists from Florence and the Low Countries, starting the Polish Renaissance. In some areas the Northern Renaissance was distinct from the Italian Renaissance in its centralization of political power.Northern Renaissance. The Northern Renaissance started latter than the Italian Renaissance, and it is not until the second half of the 15th Century that the spirit of classical revival began to take hold upon Germany, France, and England. Albrecht D rer -. Erasmus of Rotterdam. National Gallery of Art, Washington. A difference between the Northern Renaissance and the Italian Renaissance was that, while in Italy the intellectual impulse came from above, in Germany the work began at the bottom. There was a slow build up of a system of elementary education, out of which leaders were to be developed.
why were Antitrust laws were enacted ?	The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was the first measure passed by the U.S. Congress to prohibit abusive monopolies, and in some ways it remains the most important. Trusts and Monopolies. A trust was an arrangement by which stockholders in several companies transferred their shares to a single set of trustees. The Sherman Antitrust Act was the first measure enacted by the U.S. Congress to prohibit trusts (or monopolies of any type). Although several states had previously enacted similar laws, they were limited to intrastate commerce. The Sherman Antitrust Act, in contrast, was based on the constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerceSherman Antitrust Act. Sherman Antitrust Act, 1890, first measure passed by the U.S. Congress to prohibit trusts; it was named for Senator John Sherman. Prior to its enactment, various states had passed similar laws, but they were limited to intrastate businesses. Finally opposition to the concentration of economic power in large corporations and in combinations of business concerns led Congress to pass the Sherman Act. Antitrust action sharply declined in the 1920s, but under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt new acts supplementary to the Sherman Antitrust Act were passed (e.g., the Robinson-Patman Act), and antitrust action was vigorously resumed.
how much will closing cost be for the buyer	Method 1 of 4: Negotiate with the Seller. Typical closing costs are around 2-5% of the purchase price of the home. So on a $100,000 home, the closing costs will be between $2,000 - $5,000. Add this amount to a typical down payment of 20%, or $20,000, and it is easy to see why a home buyer would want to limit closing costs as much as possible. 1  1 Edit step. Points on a loan are one of the largest closing costs. Loan points are paid to the lender and are equal to 1% of the total loan amount. Points are also known as the loan origination fee. On a $100,000 mortgage 1 Point equals $1,000.Typically, home buyers will pay between about 2 and 5 percent of the purchase price of their home in closing costs. So, if your home cost $150,000, you might pay between $3,000 and $7,500 in closing costs. On average, buyers pay roughly $3,700 in closing costs, according to a recent survey. Lenders are required by law to give you a good faith estimate (GFE) of what the closing costs on your home will be within three days of when you apply for a loan. Closing costs vary widely based on where you live and the property you buy. Closing costs often include things such as: 1  A fee for running your credit report. 2  A loan origination fee, which lenders charge for processing the loan paperwork for you. 3  Attorney’s fees.
how long to respond to a police call	The Metropolitan police changed its response targets in April 2012, moving the time limit for responding to 999 emergencies from 12 minutes to 15 minutes. At the same time, however, it increased the number of call-outs to be met within this time from 75% to 90%. Targets. Each force sets its own targets for how long it should take them to respond to 999 emergencies. FOI requests to all forces in England and Wales revealed that over the past three years five police forces have changed their targets – allowing them more time to arrive at an emergency.According to American Police Beat, the average response time for an emergency call is 10 minutes. Atlanta has the worst response time with 11 to 12 minutes and Nashville comes in at a lightning speed of 9 minutes. The Department of Justice, with their statistical prowess, reports that the best response time is 4 minutes and the worst over 1 hour. Interpretation? If you live in an upper income area you probably are privy to the 4 minute response time, while middle to rural areas will see a much longer response time. If no, then we strongly suggest that you take a women's self-defense course and learn how. Because when crime comes looking for you, you don't want to be vulnerable while the minutes tick away for the average police response time to a 911 call.

what do cuboidal cells do	Simple Cuboidal Epithelium. Simple cuboidal epithelium. The cells of this type of tissue can withstand more trauma than simple squamous epithelia and are adapted for diffusion and secretion. This is one of the specializations found in epithelial tissues. Simple cuboidal epithelium is found in organs that are specialized for secretion, such as salivary glands and thyroid follicles, and those that are specialized for diffusion, such as the kidney tubules. As its name implies, this tissue consists of a single layer of cuboidal cells on the basement membrane. Examine simple cuboidal epithelium in a section of the kidney. Simple cuboidal epithelial tissue lines the tubules, which will be seen in both longitudinal and cross sectionMost secretory cells of glands are cuboidal epithelial cells. In addition, the ducts of most exocrine glands are lined by cuboidal cells as are most of the tubules in the kidneys. Simple cuboidal epithelia are found in: secretory portions exocrine and endocrine glands. Here is a labelled image of tubules! Compare the squamous cells with cuboidal types. Simple squamous epithelia are found in: alveoli and capillaries of lungs where gas exchange occurs. kidney glomerulus and tubules where filtration and diffusion processes form urine. capillaries where diffusion and osmosis occur.
when was nuclear fission first discovered	After irradiating uranium with neutrons, they were surprised to detect barium, an element only about half of the mass of uranium. The conclusion was inescapable; they had split the uranium atom into two parts. They had discovered nuclear fission -- the splitting of the atom. Two physical properties of nuclear fission are particularly exciting and important; splitting the uranium nucleus with a neutron releases energy and a few additional neutrons. Becquerel had discovered radioactivity. Radioactivity can occur naturally, or, as learned through many investigations during the first half of the 20th Century, radioactive isotopes can be produced artificially by bombarding a target nucleus with a sub-atomic-size particle, a process called transmutation.Nuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered on December 17, 1938 by German Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann, and explained theoretically in January 1939 by Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch. Frisch named the process by analogy with biological fission of living cells. Nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons. Both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons, and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart.

refrigeration cost per ton	It is equivalent to the consumption of one ton of ice per day and originated during the transition from stored natural ice to mechanical refrigeration. A refrigeration ton is approximately equivalent to 12,000 BTU / h or 3.517 kW. Air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment capacity in the U.S. is often specified in tons (of refrigeration). Many manufacturers also specify capacity in BTU / h, especially when specifying the performance of smaller equipment. (Redirected from Refrigeration ton). A ton of refrigeration (commonly abbreviated as TR) is a unit of power used in some countries (especially in North America) to describe the heat-extraction capacity of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.All costs and emissionreductions are discounted to the year of sale of the boats at a rate of 7 percent. Table 7.1-16presents the cost per ton with and without consideration of the significant fuel savings that willresult from evaporative emission control assuming a 7 percent discount rate. The cost per tonresults assuming a 3 percent discount rate are presented in Table 7.1-17. Therefore, we have alsocalculated the overall cost-effectiveness of today's rule based on a 3 percent rate to facilitatecomparison of the cost-per-ton of this rule with future proposed rules which might use the 3percent rate.
what is gingerol	Gingerol from Ginger herb-Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae, review of research Feb 25 2014. Gingerol is the active constituent of fresh ginger. Gingerol is a relative of capsaicin, the compound from chile peppers. It is normally found as a pungent yellow oil. Cooking ginger turns gingerol into zingerone, which is less pungent and has a spicy-sweet aroma. Health benefit of gingerol The oleoresin from rhizomes of ginger contains gingerol ... Health benefit of gingerol The oleoresin from rhizomes of ginger contains gingerol (1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) and its homologs which are pungent ingredients that have been found to possess many benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, liver protecting and cardiotonic effects.Gingerol, or sometimes [6]-gingerol, is the active constituent of fresh ginger. Chemically, gingerol is a relative of capsaicin and piperine, the compounds which give chilli peppers and black pepper their respective spicyness. [6]-Gingerol administered by intraperitoneal injection has been used to induce a hypothermic state in rats. Gingerol seems to be effective in an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis. Gingerol and its analogues have a favourable toxicity profile, but are cytotoxic towards a range of cancer cell lines including blood cancer and lung cancer
what is the function of the nucleus accumbens	THE PLEASURE CENTRES AFFECTED BY DRUGS. The nucleus accumbens definitely plays a central role in the reward circuit. Its operation is based chiefly on two essential neurotransmitters: dopamine, which promotes desire, and serotonin, whose effects include satiety and inhibition. Many animal studies have shown that all drugs increase the production of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, while reducing that of serotonin. Located in the midbrain, at the top of the brainstem, the VTA is one of the most primitive parts of the brain. It is the neurons of the VTA that synthesize dopamine, which their axons then send to the nucleus accumbens.The nucleus accumbens (NA) is a small part of the brain that is important for motivation, pleasure, and addiction. Sometimes called the brain's “pleasure center,” this cluster of neurons modulates the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine, on which many neural circuits depend. The nucleus accumbens is a link in the brain pathways that cause addiction and depression. Damage to this region of the brain causes a lack of motivation and inhibits addictive behavior. Linked to other other parts of the brain that modulate cycles of reward for behavior, the nucleus accumbens is part of a set of neural pathways that facilitate learning new behaviors by pleasurable reinforcement.

what age is good for pectus excavatum surgery	A Dr. Nicholas F. Fiore, MD, Pediatric Surgery, answered on behalf of Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center. The best age for pectus excavatum surgery is between 10 and 12 years old, says Nicholas Fiore, MD, a pediatric surgeon at Sunrise Hospital. A Dr. Lyall Gorenstein, MD, Thoracic Surgery (Cardiothoracic Vascular), answered on behalf of Columbia University Department of Surgery. The ideal age for surgical treatment of pectus excavatum is between 12-18 years of age. Most pectus excavatum patients—both adolescents and adults—are treated using minimally invasive techniques. Many school age patients undergo surgery during the summer months to avoid missing time in schooA comparison of the Nuss minimally invasive procedure and the Ravitch procedure, published in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery, shows no advantage for the Nuss procedure. Another procedure that has been used for pectus excavatum involves detaching the sternum from the ribs and flipping it over. This has not been as successful as the other procedures that have been described. A number of studies have been performed after the repair of pectus excavatum. The recurrence rate with the Ravitch procedure is very low (1-2%). As far as symptoms are concerned, the results can be evaluated on the basis of the specific symptoms before the operation:
where does the myelin sheath in nervous tissue	Depending on the location, different glial cell types make myelin in a different manner. Schwann cells make myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS: nerves) and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS: brain and spinal cord). In the PNS, one Schwann cell forms a single myelin sheath (Figure 1A). The ratio between axon diameter and that of the total nerve fiber (axon and myelin) is 0.6–0.7, a ratio that is well maintained regardless of the axon caliber. The length of the myelin sheath along the axon is approximately 1 mm in the PNS.Myelin is a fatty white substance that surrounds the axon dielectric (electrically insulating) material that forms a layer, the myelin sheath, usually around only the axon of a neuron. It is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. It is an outgrowth of a type of glial cell. The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination. In humans, myelination begins in the 14th week of fetal development, although little myelin exists in the brain at the time of birth. Myelin is considered a defining characteristic of the (gnathostome) vertebrates, but myelin-like sheaths have also been seen in some invertebrates, although they are quite different from vertebrate myelin at the molecular level. Myelin was discovered in 1854 by Rudolf Virchow.
what is the average cost of moving out of state	The cost of a moving company is also typically included in the moving budget. These expenses, however, are just the beginning. To understand what is the average cost of moving, you have to dig a little deeper into your personal situation. The Cost at Point A. Estimates from around the country, show that moving companies charge about $25 an hour, for each mover on the job. To get an accurate idea of average moving costs let us use the following scenario. A family relocates from a 3-bedroom home in Los Angeles to New York City. The average weight of their belongings is around 10,000 lbsAverage Moving Cost to do it Yourself. Signing for an insurance would be one of the small costs and it is about $100. Also include in your calculation a cost for hotel. Especially if your moving is at a bigger distance or out of state, you will certainly have to spend at least one night out. Depending on the prices in your area the approximate cost for one night at a hotel would be on average about $80. The average moving cost per hour varies between $85 to $95 depending on the moving date. This is the average cost for hiring two men and a truck. Usually in summer it is more expensive to move as well as at the end of the month. So checking how much the hourly rate for movers is is one of the things to do before moving.
what are the global winds patterns at the equator	Global wind patterns: Winds are named by the direction from which they blow. The globe is encircled by six major wind belts, three in each hemisphere. From pole to equator, they are the polar easterlies, the westerlies, and the trade winds. All six belts move north in the northern summer and south in the northern winter. Trade Winds: South of about 30 degrees the northern or northeast trade winds blow mostly from the northeast toward the equator. These were the sailor's favorite winds, since the weather was warm, and the winds usually blew steadily in an advantageous direction. Columbus used these to sail to the Caribbean.Also as elevation or altitude increases, air becomes less dense. Unequal heating of the Earth’s surface also forms large global wind patterns. In area near the equator, the sun is almost directly overhead for most of the year. Warm air rises at the equator and moves toward the poles. At the poles, the cooler air sinks and moves back toward the equator. However, it is not this simple. Global winds do not move directly from north to south or south to north because the Earth rotates. Trade Winds – About 30° north and south of the equator, the warm, moist air that rose vertically cools and begins to sink. Here the sky is clear. There are few clouds and little rainfall. Winds are calm.
what do the small intestine cells look like	The middle part is the jejunum. This is where most of the nutrients in food are absorbed into the blood. The last part of the small intestine is called the ileum. This part connects to the large intestine. The lining of the small intestine is covered with tiny finger-like projections called villi. They look almost like carpet. The villi help the nutrients in food to be absorbed into the blood. The villi are carpet-like fingers inside the small intestine that help absorb nutrients. The small intestine gets enzymes from two important glands, called the liver and the pancreas. The liver is the largest organ in our bodies. It makes a liquid called bile that helps digest fat. The bile is stored in another organ called the gall bladder.Within the microvilli of the small intestine are networks of capillaries and lymph vessels called lacteals. Capillaries are the smallest components of your blood vessels, the site at which your blood exchanges nutrients, oxygen and waste products with your body’s tissues. Combined, the microvilli and villi increase the surface area inside your small intestine to 500 meters squared, whereas, if the intestinal walls were smooth with no ridges, the surface area would only be 1/2 a meter squared. Think of your microvilli as little nutrient vacuums inside your small intestine.
what is granular material	Much mechanical energy is lost to heat as the particles move (think of what happens to your kinetic energy when you jump on a beanbag chair). Granular materials form what are called “collective” systems, because the particles’ touching and rubbing together is so important in determining what happens. In a sandpile, for instance, each particle touches only a few others, but these “short range” interactions determine what happens to the whole pile. Many basic products, including a variety of building materials, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and food, are granular. Because of the properties of granular materials, many processing plants operate inefficiently and sometimes experience catastrophic failures, such as the collapsing grain container shown in the photo.Granular Materials. A granular material is a collection of distinct macroscopic particles, such as sand in an hourglass or peanuts in a container. The evolution of the particles follows Newton's equations, with repulsive forces between particles that are non-zero only when there is a contact between particles. Constitutive laws for granular flows. A constitutive relation is an equation that relates the stress in a material to other known variables. The common constitutive relation in fluid dynamics sets the stress proportional to the strain rate.
what is the main function of each lobe in the brain	Most of the actual information processing in the brain takes place in the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is divided into lobes that each have a specific function. For example, there are specific areas involved in vision, hearing, touch, movement, and smell. Other areas are critical for thinking and reasoning. The cortex (thin layer of tissue) is gray because nerves in this area lack the insulation that makes most other parts of the brain appear to be white. The cortex covers the outer portion (1.5mm to 5mm) of the cerebrum and cerebellum. The portion of the cortex that covers the cerebrum is calledThe hindbrain is made of the cerebellum, pons and medulla. Often the midbrain, pons, and medulla are referred to together as the brainstem. The Cerebrum: The cerebrum or cortex is the largest part of the human brain, associated with higher brain function such as thought and action. The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. This structure is responsible for basic vital life functions such as breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. Scientists say that this is the simplest part of human brains because animals' entire brains, such as reptiles (who appear early on the evolutionary scale) resemble our brain stem.
what is a cave in geography	1 If the cave is formed in a headland, it may eventually break through to the other side forming an arch. 2  The arch will gradually become bigger until it can no longer support the top of the arch. 3  When the arch collapses, it leaves the headland on one side and a stack (a tall column of rock) on the other. ] and erosion erosion: Erosion is the process whereby rock or soil is worn away by the action of the wind, waves or water. can create caves, arches, stacks and stumps along a headland. Old Harry Rocks, Swanage, Dorset.A cave or cavern is a hollow place in the ground, especially a natural underground space large enough for a human to enter. Caves form naturally by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground. The word cave can also refer to much smaller openings such as sea caves, rock shelters, and grottos. Speleology is the science of exploration and study of all aspects of caves and the cave environment. Visiting or exploring caves for recreation may be called caving, potholing, or spelunking. 1 The cave system with the greatest total length of surveyed passage is Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, USA, at 643 km (400 mi). 2  This record is unlikely to be surpassed in the near future, as the next most extensive known cave is Jewel Cave near Custer, South Dakota, USA, at 267 km (166 mi).

how long can shrimpstay good in the freezer	Tip. For the longest storage life, keep your shrimp in a chest freezer rather than a refrigerator freezer. The relatively small freezer compartment in your fridge warms up quickly whenever you open it and takes time to return to its usual 0 degrees Fahrenheit.ip. For the longest storage life, keep your shrimp in a chest freezer rather than a refrigerator freezer. The relatively small freezer compartment in your fridge warms up quickly whenever you open it and takes time to return to its usual 0 degrees Fahrenheit.If you've bought frozen shrimp in their original packaging, the packaging will often have a Use-by or Best before date on it. That's the vendor's estimate of how long your shrimp will retain their best flavor and quality.Usually it will be 4 to 6 months for uncooked shrimp, or about half that for cooked.You can still eat them after that time -- they'll be safe for as long as they stay properly frozen -- but their texture will suffer, they'll begin to acquire off-flavors from the freezer, and eventually they'll succumb to freezer burn.ip. For the longest storage life, keep your shrimp in a chest freezer rather than a refrigerator freezer.

what is seasoning salt	Typical seasoned salt. Lawry's, the most common brand of seasoned salt in the US. Seasoned salt is a blend of table salt, herbs, spices, other flavourings, and sometimes monosodium glutamate (MSG). It is sold in supermarkets and is commonly used in fish and chip shops and other take-away food shops. It is also known as chicken salt (in Australia and in New Zealand), seasoning salt, season salt, and chip spice. Chip spice is also another variation, which originated in Kingston upon Hull and mainly contains salt and spices (such as paprika) but also contains tomato powder. Seasoned salt is often the standard seasoning on foods such as chicken, chips, deep-fried seafood, and potatoes. Most take-away shops also offer the option of normal salt. Chicken salt, as sold in Australia and New Zealand, generally contains chicken extracts, which are listed as the second ingredient after saltSeasoned salt refers to a mixture consisting of table salt along with various herbs, spices and flavorings. Common seasonings used in the blend include garlic, onion and parsley. Paprika is regularly included and gives the salt its distinctive reddish hue. Parsley is commonly used in seasoned salt. The paprika in a seasoned salt mix gives it a reddish hue. Most variety of seasoned salt contain table salt. Seasoned sea salt.
where does the radial nerve insert	The radial nerve then descends down the arm, travelling in a shallow depression on the surface of the humerus. This depression is known as the radial groove. As it moves inferiorly, the radial nerve wraps around the humerus in a lateral direction, and gives a branch to the lateral head of the triceps brachii. During its course in the arm, the nerve is accompanied by the deep branch of the brachial artery. Motor Functions. The radial nerve innervates muscles located in the arm and forearm. In the arm, it directly innervates the three heads of the triceps brachii. This muscle performs extension at the elbow. In the forearm, the deep branch of the radial nerve innervates the muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearmThe radial nerve originates as a terminal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. It goes through the arm, first in the posterior compartment of the arm, and later in the anterior compartment of the arm, and continues in the posterior compartment of the forearm. It is commonly believed that the radial nerve also provided motor innervation to the long head of the triceps. However, a study conducted in 2004 determined that, in 20 cadaveric specimens and 15 surgical dissections on participants, the long head was innervated by a branch of the axillary nerve in all cases.
biological aversion meaning	Aversion therapy works like conditioning, but it is more accurately described as counter-conditioning. With aversion therapy, we learn to associate a new negative response to a harmful stimulus that triggers unwanted behaviors. In this way, we are conditioned to avoid the unwanted behavior. Maybe you can't help biting your nails to nubs while studying for exams, but you would like to preserve your manicure another week. Aversion therapy could help. Aversion therapy is a behavioral therapy. The behavioral approach studies how we learn by association-learning that certain events occur together. That association can be made through classical conditioning, where we pair a specific stimulus to a responseSimilarly, nausea paired with most other conditioned stimuli doesn’t produce aversion to those stimuli. Pairing taste and nausea, on the other hand, produces conditioning very quickly, even with a delay of several hours between the conditioned stimulus of the taste and the unconditioned stimulus of nausea. Joe’s roommate and the movie won’t become conditioned stimuli, but the pizza will. If, right after eating the pizza, Joe gets a sharp pain in his elbow instead of nausea, it’s unlikely that he will develop an aversion to pizza as a result. Unlike nausea, the pain won’t act as an unconditioned stimulus
where is stars hollow filmed	Stars Hollow is a fictional small town in Connecticut featured on the television show Gilmore Girls. It is depicted as a close-knit small town with many quirky characters, located roughly thirty minutes by car from Hartford. It is loosely based on the towns of Essex, Wallingford, and Washington, Connecticut, but filming of the pilot was done in historical Main Street Unionville in Unionville, Ontario. Unionville, Ontario 's Main Street was used as a stand-in for Stars Hollow in the show's pilot which became the first episode. Since 2010, the Gilmore Girls set is used for the ABC Family show, Pretty Little Liars. Luke's Diner is now used as Rosewood Cafe. Hart of Dixie' s fictional Bluebell also uses the square(March 2012). Stars Hollow was inspired by and is loosely based on the actual village of Washington Depot, Connecticut (located in the middle of the western half of the state, about 45 minutes from both Hartford and New Haven) which writer Amy Sherman-Palladino once traveled through. Unionville, Ontario 's Main Street was used as a stand-in for Stars Hollow in the show's pilot which became the first episode.

what chromosome is affected by color blindness	In females, if one X chromosome is defective, the normal one will protect the woman from being color blind. Females who have a defective gene are carriers, their sons have a 50% chance of being color blind, and their daughters have a 50% chance of becoming a carrier. Color Blindness from Gene Mutations. Inherited color blindness is usually the result of receiving a genetically mutated gene on the X chromosome; however research has shown that mutations that can lead to color blindness originate from in excess of 19 different chromosomes and many different genes.The gene affects color blindness, not the other way around. It is sex linked and recessive, males that are color blind have only one gene on the X chromosome, the Y chromosome is missing the like gene. A recessive gene on the X chromosome causes men to be color blind, a recessive gene on both the X and Y chromosomes causes females to be colorblind. This makes more men colorblind than women. And it is sex linked in that the woman contributes the X chromosome to the offspring. At least that is the way I remember it. Colorblindness is a defective gene on the X chromosome. Females have 2 x chromosomes, thus one can serve as a backup for a defective gene. However, the Y chromosome in males is almost totally defective, thus does not have a backup.
how much do movers cost for local move	1 If you’re moving out of a 3-bedroom apartment or house (roughly 2000 square feet), expect to pay $800-$900 for a local moving crew of 4 members who manage to finish the local move in about 8-9 hours. 2  If your home is larger than the above examples, then the moving price can go up significantly. Make sure you keep this in mind when you speak with them to estimate moving costs. The average cost of movers for 2 men and a truck is between $90 and $120 per hour. If you decide to hire movers for labor only (without a moving truck), the professionals will charge about $60 to $80 per hour of labor. You can use our local moving cost calculator form on the top of the page as a cost estimator about the entire move1 Two movers will cost approximately $100 to $120; three movers will cost about $130 to $145; and four movers will run you $160 - $175. 2  Packing & unpacking services: The cost for packing and unpacking services is typically separate from local move fees and ranges from $25 to $35 per hour. Local moves cover a distance of 100 miles or less. There are several factors involved in pricing for local movers, including number of rooms to be moved, type of items transported and distance traveled. For a standard studio apartment with three movers required: About $260-$580 and 2-4 hours total move time.
why is chlorophyll important	The importance of chlorophyll for photosynthesis is that it captures light energy from the sun to produce glucose via a chemical reaction. Chlorophyll specifically absorbs light from the red and blue parts of the light spectrum, and reflects green light. This is the reason that plants appear green to us. Plants consist of chlorophyll molecule which is primarily responsible for them to appear green. Plants are called as autotrophs which mean that they can prepare their own food material. Plants survive by absorbing sunlight and converting carbon-di-oxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Hence this process of glucose synthesis is called as photosynthesis. The glucose that is synthesized through the photosynthetic process helps in the growth of the plant. Chlorophyll is an important molecule in the plants which act as photoreceptor. It effectively absorbs the sunlight and transfers it to the electron transporting molecules and in turn reduces the ADP and NADP molecules into energy molecules. Chlorophyll consists of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b. This molecule exists in the plant along with proteins. Chlorophyll exists as photosystem-I and photosystem-II based on the wavelength of light that each of them is able to absorb. The wavelengths that are absorbed by these photosystems are 700nm and 680nm
what is scope parallax	Parallax can be defined appropriately to rifle scopes as the apparent movement of objects within the field of view in relation to the reticle. In a telescopic sight, parallax occurs when the “primary image” of the object is formed either in front of, or behind the reticle. It is also important to know that in every scope, there is some one shooting distance at which there is no parallax. In most rifle scopes this one point of zero parallax is usually placed at a suitable mid-range point in the scopes' focal range. In lower-quality scopes, there are other sources of parallax.While adjustment in parallax on rifle scopes is not required, there are a lot of target shootesa who want this to be present in their scopes for easy targetting and shooting. Sometimes, the parallax is of concern because shooters want their rifle scopes to be clear and make their shooting accurate most of the time. Almost all brands don’t have the feature of adjusting the parallex but rather have a pre-set to be parallax free at around 100-200 yards, while shotguns are set at 50. A rifle scope parallax is a known optical illusion where the target looks out of focus and the focal plance of the target is offset from rifle scope reticle. It is the apparent movement of the reticle when the eyes move off center of the sight picture
what is the vegetable lovage and what is called in greek	Lovage is an erect, herbaceous, perennial plant growing to 1.8–2.5 m (5.9–8.2 ft) tall, with a basal rosette of leaves and stems with further leaves, the flowers being produced in umbels at the top of the stems. The name lovage is from love-ache, ache being a medieval name for parsley; this is a folk-etymological corruption of the older French name levesche, from late Latin levisticum, in turn thought to be a corruption of the earlier Latin ligusticum, of Liguria  (northwest Italy), where the herb was grown extensively.The leaves can be used in salads, or to make soup or season broths, and the roots can be eaten as a vegetable or grated for use in salads. Its flavor and smell is somewhat similar to celery. The seeds can be used as a spice, similar to fennel seeds. In the UK, an alcoholic lovage cordial is traditionally mixed with brandy in the ratio of 2:1 as a winter drink. In Romania, the leaves are the preferred seasoning for the various local broths, much more so than parsley or dill.

civil rights laws timeline	A Civil Rights Timeline: 1956-1950. 1956: The first two months of the year, whites are angry about the Montgomery Bus Boycott, this anger results in the bombing of 4 African-American churches as well as the homes of civil rights leaders and E.D. Nixon and Martin Luther King, Jr. This movement, as well as the Black Power Movement between the 1960’s and 1970’s, expanded the goals of the Civil Rights Movement beyond ending racial discrimination by including the feelings of political and economic self-sufficiency, racial dignity, and freedom from any oppression by white Americans.A civil right is an enforceable right or privilege, which if interfered with by another gives rise to an action for injury. Examples of civil rights are freedom of speech, press, and assembly; the right to vote; freedom from involuntary servitude; and the right to equality in public places. Discrimination occurs when the civil rights of an individual are denied or interfered with because of their membership in a particular group or class. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination where the employer is engaged in interstate commerce. Congress has passed numerous other laws dealing with employment discrimination.

cortana what causes a bladder infection	Causes of Urinary Tract Infections. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in cats are caused by microorganisms that enter the urinary tract, travel through the urethra and typically settle in the bladder. The urethra is the tube that connects the urinary bladder to the outside world. Infection of the bladder caused by bacteria is called “bacterial cystitis.” Occasionally, other organisms are the culprit, including mycoplasma, viruses, algae and fungi. Sometimes, the infective organisms migrate from the bladder through the ureters, lodging in the kidneys.A bladder infection occurs when microbes (usually bacteria) get into the bladder and proliferate. Any dog can get a bladder infection, though females are more likely to get one. Because the disease irritates the organ, it increases the pet’s urge to urinate. Frequent squatting or straining without a lot of results is the biggest sign a pet has a bladder infection. Urine might also be cloudy or tinged with blood. Bladder infections can even lead to bladder stones (and vice versa). Treatment for the infection includes a course of antibiotics. If stones occur they must be removed through surgery, broken up by sounds waves, or eliminated via a special diet. Overview. The bladder is an expandable sac, like a balloon, that lies toward the back of the abdomen.
what are river deltas	A river delta is a land form that forms at the mouth of a river,  where the river flows into an ocean, sea, estuary, lake or  reservoir. They are formed from the deposition … of the sediment  carried by the river as the flow leaves the mouth of the river in  smaller channels and dis-tributaries. A delta is formed when sediments and mud from a large river meet the salt water of a sea or ocean. It can be described as a low tract of alluvial land. Deltas often change in size based on ocean and river currents. A delta forms a mouth at the end of a lake.This makes it to where the lake can flow into the ocean.A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or standing water. This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or (more rarely) another river that cannot transport away the supplied sediment. Despite a popular legend, this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus. Once a wave-or river-distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there's a lot of water around – such as floods or storm surges. These distributaries slowly silt up at a pretty constant rate until they fizzle out.
what type of body cavity do reptiles have	The sense organs of snakes are uniquely different than those of mammals and other animals. Unlike mammals, which mainly rely on their sight and hearing, snakes rely primarily on their senses of smell and touch. They do not have moveable eyelids, but transparent caps called brille as protective eye coverings. Because of this, their eye movement is fairly limited. Snakes also smell in a very different way than mammals. Mammals bring air particles into contact with the olfactory (smelling) nerves by breathing them into the nasal cavities through the nostrils. Snakes have both nostrils and nasal cavities, but they are not used to smell.Coelom is a greek work literally meaning body cavity. A body cavity is a space between the alimentary canal and body wall. When it is lined by a layer of mesoderm, then it is … called a true coelom. Depending upon this the animals are classified into Acoelomates-Animals which don't have body cavity. Eg: Platyhelminthes Pseudocoelomates-Animals in which the body cavity is formed from embryonic blastocoel. A coelomate organism has a fluid filled body cavity and have a complete lining from the mesoderm. This allows organs to be attached together in a specific order but still have … space to move around. Most bilateral organisms are coelomates. 12 people found this useful.
is sichuan a province in china	9) Most of Sichuan Province's population is Han Chinese. However, there is a significant population of minorities such as Tibetans, Yi, Qiang and Naxi in the province as well. Sichuan was China's most populous province until 1997 when Chongqing was separated from it. Sichuan is an important province to China because of its abundant agricultural resources which include such Chinese staples as rice and wheat. Sichuan is also rich in mineral resources and is one of China's main industrial centers.Sichuan Province. Located in the upper reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River in the southwest part of China, it is bounded by Shaanxi, Gansu,Qinghai,Yunnan, Guizhou, Xizang(Tibet) and Chongqing Municipality, and has long been known as a land of plenty or Heaven on Earth for its abundance of products. Area: about 480000km2. Sichuan has a varied topography. Mountainous areas occupy its west, and Sichuan Basin and its peripheral highlands predominate in the east. The relief of the eastern region is in sharp contrast to that of the west. The precipitation is lower in the west than in the east. Sichuan has a long history and was once the place of the Ba and Shu States during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, therefore, possessing a great number of cultural relics and historic sites.
difference between male and female crabs dungeness	Let’s start by taking a look at their physical differences. There are two ways to identify your crab as being either male or female including claw color and apron shape. First, take a look at the crab’s claws. Male crabs will have bright blue claws like the first picture below. Female crabs, however, have red tips on their claws like in the second picture. Male blue crabs. Female blue crabs – Taken by Angel Perry. A second way to tell the difference between males and females is by the shape of their “apron”. If you look at a crab’s underside, there’s a flap with a distinct shape. This flap is referred to as the apron. Male blue crabs (Jimmies) have a long, pointy apron as seen in the first picture belowMost crab-care books state that it is impossible to tell the sex between male and female land hermit crabs. Actually I have found that is not that difficult, provided your hermit crab is willing to come rather far out of its shell for you. The female land hermit crab has tiny genital openings called gonopores. The gonopores are the openings into which the male crab places his spermatophore during mating. The male crab, gently tapping and rocking the female crab, encourages her to come out of her shell. The crabs mate in a position where the female's gonopores line up with male's fifth pair of legs.
time take for chicken pieces to bake	Step 2: Bake the chicken pieces. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the chicken pieces, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until no longer pink (internal temperature should be 170 degrees F for chicken breasts, 180 degrees F for thighs and drumsticks). To store: Let the baked chicken stand for 30 minutes to cool.ut the chicken in the roasting pan into the preheated oven. The chicken cooking times vary by weight and by recipe, but in general, follow these guidelines: 2-1/2- to 3-pound chicken: Roast 1 to 1-1/4 hours. 3- to 3-1/2-pound chicken: Roast 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours.Baked Chicken Pieces. If you want chicken to cook faster, cut it into pieces and arrange them in a shallow baking dish. Place the chicken into an oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake legs, thighs and wings for 35 to 45 minutes and bone-in breasts 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces.Bake boneless breasts for 20 to 30 minutes, cutlets or tenderloins for 15 to 20 minutes and boneless thighs 25 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.ake legs, thighs and wings for 35 to 45 minutes and bone-in breasts 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces.

why does copper wire turn green	Freshly formed, copper is a beautiful rosy-pink color. Before long, however, it changes to a darker russet-brown. Under certain circumstances, it may turn red, black or blue-green. Environment. Copper metal that is required to maintain its color may be treated with an organic coating. Single-strand copper wire for electrical purposes does not usually tarnish enough to warrant special treatment. However, fine, multistranded copper wire is usually wrapped with layers of insulating materials. If the wire is kept wrapped, oxidation is quite low, and its color is maintained. Naked copper, however, will inevitably change color according to its particular environment. AttackCopper is a pinkish colour when it is new, but soon turns a reddish orange color after it is exposed to air. Copper is one of the few coloured metals. Most metals are gray or silver. Gold, copper, caesium and osmium are the only four coloured metals. Copper is green as copper(II) carbonate and copper(II) hydroxide. It turns green because it oxidises. After a time in the air, copper forms green copper carbonate at the surface, called verdigris. That is why the copper roof of a building looks green. Copper is very flexible and ductile. It can be stretched into wires easily. Copper is also very soft, it has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3.
about how many carbs a day should a diabetic have	Snacks should be limited to one serving of carbs, or 15 grams. Examples include: a small fruit, three graham crackers, six ounces of yogurt, 1/2 cup of sugar-free pudding, 1/2 cup of low-fat cottage cheese with 1/4 cup of fruit, five wheat crackers, two rice cakes or one granola bar. Meal Range. A general range of carbohydrate intake for a diabetic is between 30 and 60 grams per meal. For women, dietitians usually suggest 30 to 45. For men, the amount is 45 to 60 grams.The amount of carbs you can eat depends on your age, sex, height, weight, and activity level. On average females can have 3-4 servings of carbs for each meal, and a serving of carbs in between meals. A serving of carbohydrates is 15 grams of carbs. On average, a male can have 5-6 servings of carbs for each meal and a serving of carb in between each meal. Remember, though, that the type of carb matters to. As a diabetic, you should choose carbs that are whole grains. Whole grains contain fiber and nutrients, and they help keep you satiated longer. A Intermountain Healthcare answered. If you have diabetes and you're counting carbohydrates (carbs), keep these guidelines in mind: 1  Women need about 3 to 4 carb servings per meal (or split between a meal and a snack). 2  Men need about 4 to 5 carb servings per meal (or meal and snack).
unsaturated hydrocarbon definition	(December 2009). Unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that have double or triple covalent bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. Those with at least one carbon to carbon double bond are called alkenes and those with at least one carbon to carbon triple bond are called alkynes. The position of the double or triple bond is shown by a number written either at the start of the name, or just before the-ene or-yne suffix (e.g. pent-2-ene and 2-butyne). Alkenes and alkynes with more than one double or triple bond respectively are named with a prefix preceding the-ene or-yne (e.g. 2,4-pentadiene). Unsaturated hydrocarbons with both double and triple bonds have the suffix-enyne and are handled in a similar manner. The physical properties of unsaturated hydrocarbons are very similar to those of the corresponding saturated compounds. They are slightly soluble in waterUnsaturated hydrocarbons are compounds that consist only of the elements carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) and contain at least one carbon-carbon double or triple bond. Below are examples of the unsaturated hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds that only consist of the elements hydrogen and carbon. In this lesson, we will focus on one type of hydrocarbon: unsaturated hydrocarbons, and its three types-alkenes, alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons.

what does an oriole bird look like	BULLOCK’S ORIOLE. Bullock’s orioles are the most widespread orioles in the West, where they prefer to nest in tall trees along streams and rivers. They are named in honor of William Bullock and his son, who did extensive ornithological work in Mexico in the early 1800s. 1 These birds are attracted to the color orange, so look for a sugar-water feeder specifically designed for orioles. 2  Make sure your feeder has large enough perches and drinking ports. 3  It’s not unusual for orioles to try hummingbird feeders, but their bills are often too big.Feeding Habits-What Orioles Eat. The diet of the Baltimore Oriole consist of insects, fruits, and flower nectar. You can attract this bird to eat from your backyard fruit feeder by setting out orange halves or grape jelly. Our recommended Fruit Feeder. Another option is by providing a sugar water mixture. The male bird is black with orange underparts, rump, shoulders, and sides of tail. His wings have 2 white wing bars. The females is olive above, yellowish below with 2 white wing bars. This particular Oriole bird is found east of the Rockies. Its western counterpart; the Bullock's Oriole, is similar in appearance. The male has an orange face, black eyeline and a large white wing patch. The female Bullock has a yellowish head and breast and whitish belly
how long is lamb gestation	The normal cycle for ewes is approximately 17 days between heat periods. However, it can vary from 14 to 19 days. Duration of estrus, or heat period. The heat period usually lasts 30 to 35 hours, with a range of 20 to 42 hours. Ovulation occurs late in the period. Gestation period. The normal gestation period of ewes is approximately 147 days, ranging from 144 to 152 days. The medium-wool breeds and meat-type breeds ordinarily have a shorter gestation period than do the fine-wool breeds. High temperatures and high nutrition levels may shorten the gestation period two or three days. Ewes that are in poor body condition due to age and/or missing teeth should be culled. Ewes with chronic hoof problems (e.g. foot rot) should be culled. Gestation (pregnancy) The average gestation length in sheep varies from 142 to 152 days. The average is 147 days. Crossbred ewe lambs cycle at a younger age than purebred ewe lambs. The estrus (or heat) cycle Reproduction in non-human mammals is regulated by an estrus cycle. In sheep, the length of the estrus cycle ranges from 13 to 19 days and averages 17 days. The phases of the estrous cycle are proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Estrus is the period of time when the ewe is receptive to the ram and will stand for mating. It lasts approximately 24 to 36 hour
what is a waterspout	Formation [edit]. Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. The cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur. Most waterspouts do not suck up water; they are small and weak rotating columns of airA waterspout is a whirling column of air and water mist. According to NOAA's National Weather Service, the best way to avoid a waterspout is to move at a 90-degree angle to its apparent movement. Never move closer to investigate a waterspout. Some can be just as dangerous as tornadoes. Waterspouts fall into two categories: fair weather waterspouts and tornadic waterspouts. Tornadic waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water. They have the same characteristics as a land tornado. While tornadic waterspouts develop downward in a thunderstorm, a fair weather waterspout develops on the surface of the water and works its way upward. By the time the funnel is visible, a fair weather waterspout is near maturity. Fair weather waterspouts form in light wind conditions so they normally move very little.
andrew jackson established the precedent that a president’s veto can be used	Andrew Jackson was the seventh President of the United States from 1829 to 1837, seeking to act as the direct representative of the common man. More nearly than any of his predecessors, Andrew Jackson was elected by popular vote; as President he sought to act as the direct representative of the common man. Jackson prospered sufficiently to buy slaves and to build a mansion, the Hermitage, near Nashville. He was the first man elected from Tennessee to the House of Representatives, and he served briefly in the Senate.Other Presidents facing a hostile Congress used the veto extensively, with some disastrous results. John Tyler used the veto after he was expelled from his own party while in office. Tyler issued 10 vetoes in four years, with just one overridden by Congress. President Andrew Johnson was on the outs with the Republicans after President Lincoln’s assassination in 1865, and his vetoing ways led to an impeachment trial. Johnson used the regular veto 21 times in four years, but 15 of his vetoes were overridden. Jackson’s veto set a precedent because it was on political as well as constitutional grounds. But the Founders had actually anticipated that the veto would be used for both purposes. Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 73 that he feared the President wouldn’t use the veto enough.
when were interpreters first used on tv	During MTV's first few years on the air, very few black artists were included in rotation on the channel. The select few who were in MTV's rotation were Michael Jackson, Prince, Eddy Grant, Donna Summer, Musical Youth, and Herbie Hancock. Since the premiere of the short-lived FNMTV in 2008, MTV has used a revised, chopped version of its traditional logo during most of its on-air programming. This new logo was finalized and formally became MTV's official brand mark on February 8, 2010, when it debuted on MTV's website.The first sign language interpreters were hearing family members, friends, and coworkers. They were not formally trained. Their qualifications included knowledge of English, some sign language, and a willingness to step in. The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) the national professional organization for American Sign Language interpreters in the United States--was established in 1964 and incorporated in 1974. RID established interpreter certification standards and put into place a code of ethics for practitioner members. In the early 1970 s, interpreter training programs (ITP) were established that were generally six to eight weeks in duration. These programs focused primarily on settings in which interpreters might expect to work (religious, telephone, courtroom, medical)
cost of dermabrasion procedure	The average cost of microdermabrasion is $143, according to 2014 statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The cost of microdermabrasion treatment can vary. The average fee referenced above does not include anesthesia, facilities or other related expenses. Prices may also be based on the expertise and qualifications of the person performing the treatment, type of microdermabrasion procedure performed, time and effort the procedure requires, and the geographic location of the office. Be sure to ask your surgeon about all costs involved in your microdermabrasion treatmentIn most cases the fee for a dermabrasion varies with the extent that it is needed to be performed. The cost for full face dermabrasion is around $3000. If you have acne scars and want only your cheeks treated, expect to pay about $2000. If you want only your lips treated, you might pay as little as $1000. There is another important aspect to the cost of dermabrasion procedures which most people are not aware of. Home Cost of Dermabrasion Surgery. More and more people are going for cosmetic surgery these days. More than 65% of people who undergo cosmetic surgery today have family incomes under $50,000. This figure clearly points towards the fact that, it is not only the rich and famous who are going for the surgery.
how much does it cost to own a daycare	The average cost of center-based daycare in the United States is $11,666 per year ($972 a month), but prices range from $3,582 to $18,773 a year ($300 to $1,564 monthly), according to the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies (NACCRRA). Nanny care costs significantly less in, say, St. Louis than in Manhattan simply because the cost of living is lower there and so are wages. And daycare – whether in a center or in someone's home – could cost double or triple per month in a relatively expensive city compared to a cheaper area. Your best bet is to check with friends and caregivers near you to determine the going rate for the type of childcare you preferCosts for daycare for preschool-age children are generally lower, averaging $8,800 a year ($733 a month). Depending on where you live, you'll pay anywhere from $4,460 to $13,185 a year ($371 to $1,100 a month). Nanny care costs significantly less in, say, St. Louis than in Manhattan simply because the cost of living is lower there and so are wages.

what is the molecular formula of benzene	For instance, suppose we believe our sample is benzene (C 6 H 6). We can compare the following: 1  The empirical formula (CH) obtained from the molecular formula of benzene (C 6 H 6). 2  The empirical formula obtained from a elemental analysis of the sample. To do this, we need to determine the empirical formula from the molecular formula. To determine the empirical formula of a known substance, such as glucose, we take the subscripts of the molecular formula (C 6 H 12 O 6) and reduce then to the simplest whole number ratios. If we divide this by 6, we get C 1 H 2 O 1.For example, n-hexane, a chemical compound has the molecular formula CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, implying that it has a straight chain structure, 6 carbon atoms, and 14 hydrogen atoms. Hexane's molecular formula is C6H14, and its empirical formula would be C3H7 showing a C:H ratio of 3:7. As you have asked Benzene that is C6H6 Here the ratio of carbon and hydrogen is 1:1 And Acetylene that is C2H2 Here also the ratio is 1:1 Hence the empirical formula is the same but different masses. I hope you get it. Both have the same number of carbon (C) and hydrogen atoms (H). But benzene's formula is C6H6; acetylene is C2H2. A single molecule of benzene has exactly 3 times as many atoms as acetylene. So a mole of benzene will have 3 times the mass.

what makes pretzel dough different	The taste of the pretzel is a result of ingredients such as salt, sugar, and flavorings. Salt is used in the batter at about 1%. It helps to make the dough stronger in addition to improving the taste. Sugars such as sucrose or corn syrup are used for about 2% of the pretzel dough. Flour. In pretzel dough making, flour is perhaps the most important ingredient. It is primarily made up of starch and protein. When water is added, the flour protein soaks up the water rapidly and reacts with it to form a mass known as gluten. The gluten can be stretched and formed quite a distance with-out breakingA pretzel (German: Brezel or Breze) is a type of baked bread product made from dough most commonly shaped into a twisty knot. Pretzels originated in Europe, most likely among monasteries in the Early Middle Ages. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive symmetrical looped form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted back into itself in a certain way (a pretzel loop). Pretzels now come in different shapes. The pretzel shape is used for a variety of sweet pastries made of different types of dough (flaky, brittle, soft, crispy) with a variety of toppings (icing, nuts, seeds, cinnamon). Around Christmas they can be made of soft gingerbread ( Lebkuchen ) with chocolate coating.

how to edit using vi	Using vi. Before I get into how to use vi, it's important to understand that there are two basic modes for vi: insert mode and command mode. Insert mode is the mode where you type and things appear on the screen. Command mode is the mode where you type and things happen, instead of text appearing. They will not show up in the file when you save it. To edit a specific document or to give a blank document a name, you can also type vi filename, where filename is an existing file or the name you want the new file to have.Starting vi. To start using vi, at the Unix prompt type vi followed by a file name. If you wish to edit an existing file, type in its name; if you are creating a new file, type in the name you wish to give to the new file. %vi filename Then hit Return. vi has two modes: the command mode and the insert mode. It is essential that you know which mode you are in at any given point in time. When you are in command mode, letters of the keyboard will be interpreted as commands. When you are in insert mode the same letters of the keyboard will type or edit text. vi always starts out in command mode. When you wish to move between the two modes, keep these things in mind. You can type i to enter the insert mode. If you wish to leave insert mode and return to the command mode, hit the ESC key
what do juxtamedullary nephrons do	Juxtamedullary nephron, on the other hand, have a loop of Henle that extends past the cortex and into the medulla of the kidney. Blood arrives to the nephron due to the afferent arteriole. This arteriole then divides into a mass of capillaries, called the glomerulus. Each kidney in a human contains about a million nephrons. These nephrons make the actual changes to the blood composition. There are two types of nephron: cortical nephron and juxtamedullary nephron. The main difference in the two types of nephron is the length to which the loop of Henle extends into the kidney. Cortical nephron, which are about eighty percent of the nephron in humans, have a loop of Henle that does not extend past the cortex of the kidneyIn other words, a juxtamedullary nephron is one where the renal corpuscle is close to the medulla, and the proximal convoluted tubule and its associated loop of Henle occur at a deep position compared to most other nephrons. This type of nephron is relatively rare, and only comprise 20–30% of the nephrons in the human kidney. However, in most depictions of the nephron, it is a juxtamedullary nephron which is depicted. The greater gradient in the deep medulla make this type of nephron do more work than more shallow nephrons, and their vertical nature makes them easier to illustrate

what is a pyramid of biomass	An ecological pyramid (also trophic pyramid, energy pyramid, or sometimes food pyramid) is a graphical representation designed to show the biomass or bio productivity at each trophic level in a given ecosystem. Biomass is the amount of living or organic matter present in an organism. Biomass pyramids show how much biomass is present in the organisms at each trophic level, while productivity pyramids show the production or turnover in biomass. An energy pyramid is a presentation of the trophic levels in an ecosystem. Energy from the sun is transferred through the ecosystem by passing through various trophic levels. Roughly 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, thus preventing a large amounts ofBiomass-the total dry weight of the organisms in a trophic levelBiomass Pyramid-a diagram showing the biomass at each trophic level of a food chain A pyramid of biomass s … hows energy lost in each trophic level while a pyramid of numbers shows the numbers of the organisms in each trophic level.

what is fish back	A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward.Fish back is the remains of processed fish, where the filet has been taken off and what's left is called 'fish back' or cuttings, mainly the head, the tail and the fins, and it is now becoming part of the protein diet in our meals, he stated. Mr Speaker, the impoverishment of our people has gotten worse since 2012. People are no longer talking about oxtail and curry goat. As a matter of fact, chicken back is now priced way above the means of many Jamaicans. What many are forced to buy these days is fish back, he told the House. The government benches responded with dismay, obviously hearing the term, fish back, for the first time. But, Holness insisted that the protein had replaced chicken back, as the staple for poor Jamaicans

what is incontinent urine	Urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine; in simple terms, to wee when you don't intend to. It is the inability to hold urine in the bladder because voluntary control over the urinary sphincter is either lost or weakened. Urinary incontinence is a much more common problem than most people realize. In the United Kingdom it is estimated that at any one time at least 3 million people - 5% of the total population-suffer from urinary incontinence. Also known as reflex incontinence. This is the second most common type of urinary incontinence. The bladder is either unstable or overactive. There is a sudden, involuntary contraction of the muscular wall of the bladder (detrusor muscles) that causes urinary urgency-an urge to urinate that cannot be stopped.Urinary incontinence is the accidental release of urine. It can happen when you cough, laugh, sneeze, or jog. Or you may have a sudden need to go to the bathroom but can't get there in time. Bladder control problems are very common, especially among older adults. Urge incontinence is caused by an overactive bladder muscle that pushes urine out of the bladder. It may be caused by irritation of the bladder, emotional stress, or brain conditions such as Parkinson's disease or stroke. Many times doctors don't know what causes it. 1 | 2 | 3.
symptoms and causes of vertigo	1 Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). 2  This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. 3  These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. 4  BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. Other causes of dizziness. 1  Neurological conditions. 2  Some neurological disorders — such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis — can lead to progressive loss of balance. 3  Medications. 4  Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications — such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers.Common causes of dizziness include inner-ear disorders, medications, and alcohol. Dizziness is often a result of vertigo. It can also be caused by a problem in the inner ear, where balance is regulated. The most common cause of vertigo and vertigo-related dizziness is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Dizziness is not a disease but a symptom of other disorders. Vertigo and disequilibrium may cause a feeling of dizziness, but those two terms describe different symptoms. Vertigo is characterized by a feeling of spinning. Disequilibrium is a loss of balance or equilibrium. True dizziness is the feeling of lightheadedness or nearly fainting

who was the ballpoint pen invented by	The first crude ballpoint pen was patented in 1888 by John Loud, an American leather tanner. The next stage of development came almost fifty years after Loud's patent, with … an improved version invented in Hungary in 1935 by Laszlo László Jozsef (József biro, bíró - September 29, 1899) november 24 1985. and his brother The first country to invent the ballpoint pen was the United  States. John Jacob Loud, an American inventor, is known for  designing the first ballpoint pen. However, it did … not become a  viable commercial endeavor until Biro Pens of Argentina was founded  in 1941. 1 person found this useful.More history and information on: pencils, pens, erasers, pencils, pencil sharpeners, ballpoint pens, and more. No man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand, or more wise when he had - Samuel Johnson. A Hungarian journalist named Laszlo Biro invented the first ballpoint pen in 1938. Biro had noticed that the type of ink used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge-free. This principle of the ballpoint pen actually dates back to an 1888 patent owned by John J. Loud for a product to mark leather. However, this patent was commercially unexploited. Laszlo Biro first patented his pen in 1938, and applied for a fresh patent in Argentina on June 10, 1943.
definition of ogive curve	An ogive is a curve that represents cumulative frequencies of the given variables. The graph of the cumulative frequency distribution is better known as the cumulative frequency curve or Ogive. The word Ogive is basically a term used in the architecture to describe curves or curved shapes. Let us go ahead and understand about the cumulative frequency curve in this page. The cumulative frequency curve is also known as Ogive. Just to recall that the cumulative frequency of a variable is the summation of all the frequencies of variables previous to it.An Ogive is a round shaped graph, in which the ends of the shape can be two dimensional or three dimensional. The cumulative frequency curve is the other name of ogive curve. The shape of ogive is pointed and curved and the ogives are used in making the bullets or other projectiles. Ogive is used in projectiles. It is also used to find the median of frequency distribution. Some algorithms are there which help us to understand ogives definition as follows: Algorithm 1: Step 1: First, draw two types of frequency curves on the graph paper. There are four types of frequency distributive graphs namely histogram, frequency polygon, frequency curves and ogive graph. Basically, aâ ogivea ogiveâ is a term that is used to describe the curves and. curved shapes
what is the difference between discipleship and evangelism	Another key difference in Evangelism & Discipleship is not just preach Jesus for Salvation but to share and apply the teachings of the Bible to the everyday real life issues-showing how Bible or God sees and solve the issues of lives. The third difference, not clear in the title itself, is in the message of Grace-the completed work of Christ gives us the ability the live the life that we should. We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ for good works to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. We are to live out the Christ within us.Evangelism and discipleship are linked together. Evangelism results in converts, and converts are trained to become disciples. Disciples evangelize to reach more converts, who are trained to become disciples. So evangelism leads to disciples and disciples evangelize until the Gospel is spread throughout the world. Consider the relationship of evangelism and discipleship with missions. Christian missions involve proclaiming the Gospel across cultures. So a missionary spreads the Gospel to a people group or culture different from his own. Evangelism and discipleship are the processes by which mission work is accomplished. Evangelism and discipleship also occur within one’s own culture, so not all evangelism and discipleship falls within the context of missions
good food for healthy nerves	Healthy Food for the Nerves. Your nerve impulses allow you to flex your muscles. You may have heard of brain food and a heart-healthy diet, but certain foods also help boost your nerve health. A vast network of nerves connects your brain and spinal cord -- the central nervous system -- to every part of your body through the peripheral nervous system. Sunflower Seeds. Sunflower seeds are versatile as a low-fat snack or tossed into a salad or stew. They are a good source of vitamin B-6, an important nutrient for nerve health and energy production in your body. This essential vitamin is necessary in the production of chemicals that send messages between neurons in nerves. Low levels of vitamin B-6 can lead to muscle fatigue and other symptomsFoods Good for Nerves: Nerve damage that results from injury or illness can be repaired through consumption of foods that are beneficial for the immune system. Such foods include those that contain vitamins A, B, C and D, minerals and some antioxidants. Before we spell out a diet for nerves, it is important to understand that for the nervous system to operate in a healthy manner, diet, exercise, and relaxation must all go hand in hand. If you are suffering from nervous disorders, diet alone will not help. Work on improving stress resistance and sleep patterns.
example of a asexual organisms	Reproduction (or procreation) is the biological process by which new individual organisms – offspring – are produced from their parents. Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual. In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to single-celled organisms. The cloning of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle for biologists.Organisms, both prokaryotes (the archaea and the bacteria), and eukaryotes (such as protists and unicellular fungi), reproduce asexually through binary fission; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction. Another type of fission is multiple fission that is advantageous to the plant life cycle. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants.
what is mean egd test/	An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) test is performed to examine the lining of your esophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects your throat to your stomach and the duodenum-the upper part of the small intestine.

An upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy may be done to: 1  Find problems in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. 2  These problems can include: 3  Inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or the stomach (gastritis). 4  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) . 5  A narrowing (stricture) of the esophagus.
what is cross monitoring	If the system senses cross traffic, it warns you by flashing the side mirror indicators and sounding a warning tone. Please click here to view a video. [1] Do not rely exclusively on the Blind Spot Monitor to determine if a lane change is safe. Always look over your shoulder and use your turn signal before changing lanes. There are several limitations to the function, detection, range and clarity of the monitor. To learn more, see the Owner's Manual. [2] Do not rely exclusively on the Rear Cross-Traffic Alert system. Always look over your shoulder and use your mirrors to confirm rear clearance. There are limitations to the function, detection, range and clarity of the system. To learn more, see your Owner's ManualThis alert indicator will dim when the system detects nighttime darkness. Cross Traffic Alert will also sound a series of tones and trigger a message in the information display to indicate that a vehicle is approaching on your right or left. Cross Traffic Alert works in tandem with the reverse sensing system, which sounds its own series of tones. Never use the Cross Traffic Alert system as a replacement for checking the interior and exterior mirrors and looking over your shoulder before slowly backing out of a parking space. Cross Traffic Alert is not a replacement for careful driving.
viral infections caused by deer mice	Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). Severe HPS. Image courtesy D. Loren Ketai, M.D. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in humans caused by infection with a hantavirus. Anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry hantavirus is at risk of HPS. Rodent infestation in and around the home remains the primary risk for hantavirus exposure. Even healthy individuals are at risk for HPS infection if exposed to the virus. In fact, in a study of health care workers who were exposed to either patients or specimens infected with related types of hantaviruses (which cause a different disease in humans), none of the workers showed evidence of infection or illness. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) Topics.The viral cause of the disease was found only weeks later and was called the Sin Nombre virus (SNV, in Spanish,  virus sin nombre , for nameless virus). The host was first identified as the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) by Terry Yates, a professor at the University of New Mexico. Hantaviruses are single-stranded, enveloped, negative sense RNA viruses in the Bunyaviridae family. They normally infect rodents and do not cause disease in these hosts. Humans may become infected with hantaviruses through contact with rodent urine, saliva, or feces.
what gpa do you need to get your md degree	A Bachelor's Degree Most medical schools require a completed Bachelor's degree, but not all schools do. Some schools only require completion of the pre-requisite courses, as listed previously, and at least 92 completed credits (you are a senior at that point). Having completed a Master's Degree or PhD is advantageous for admissions and may give you an edge by making you stand out from your peers, but is not required by any medical school for admission. These degrees are especially helpful when applying to some of the more prestigious medical schools.Originally Posted by SurfDoctor I've been musing on the idea that the GPA you earn while attaining a doctorate degree is not all that important anymore. I busted my hump earning a high GPA on my masters, but I'm not sure that it is all that relevant once you reach your terminal degree. Of course there is a minimum GPA to be able to stay in a program and I think that's usually a 3.0, what I'm wondering is whether there is any benefit to having a GPA that is higher. Some programs have a minimum GPA in coursework to qualify for comprehensives. Your dissertation is what people will review and question. Originally Posted by SurfDoctor.

what is deep fermentation	Naturally-present lactic-acid bacteria (LAB), one of which is Lc. mesenteroides, produce lactic and acetic acids that: Walk through any untended apple orchard on a beautiful fall day, and take a good deep whiff of fallen apples, lying in the grass. What you smell, and probably see, is a spontaneous, and natural, lacto-fermentation process! The apple’s deep, almost heady perfume is magnified – richer and more complex than apples still remaining on the tree. Simply put, lacto-fermentation is a microbial process using beneficial bacteria including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. and other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (commonly known as probiotics), which thrive in an anaerobic fermenting environment.Beer fermenting at a brewery. Fermentation in food processing is the conversion of carbohydrates to alcohols and carbon dioxide or organic acids using yeasts, bacteria, or a combination thereof, under anaerobic conditions. Fermentation usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desirable. Beer and bread, two major uses of fermentation in food. The primary benefit of fermentation is the conversion of sugars and other carbohydrates into preservative organic acids, e.g. converting juice into wine, grains into beer, carbohydrates into carbon dioxide to leaven bread, and sugars in vegetables.

can innate immune response cause autoimmunity	Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function.Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key receptors that activate the innate immunity in response to pathogen recognition. Recent data show that activation of innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) can break this state of tolerance and induce autoimmunity by priming autoreactive T cells. The role of innate immune responses in autoimmune disease development. Waldner H. Autoimmune diseases are systemic or organ-specific disorders that are the result of an attack of the immune system against the body's own tissue. Development of autoimmune disease is generally avoided by distinct mechanisms that silence adaptive self-reactive T or B cells. The innate immune system is critically involved in the defense against pathogens and the induction of primary adaptive immune response

where do debris avalanches commonly occur	Avalanches are rapid movements of large masses of snow down a slope that commonly occur in mountainous regions. Despite what you may have seen in movies and on television, shouting cannot trigger an avalanche, according to the Utah Avalanche Centre. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. Slides of rocks or debris, behaving in a similar way to snow, are also referred to as avalanches (see rockslide).A debris avalanche is formed when an unstable slope collapses and debris is transported away from the slope. Large scale avalanches normally occur on very steep volcanoes. There are two general types of debris avalanches: those that are cold and those that are hot. A cold debris avalanche usually results from a slope becoming unstable whereas a hot debris avalanche is the result of volcanic activity such as volcanic earthquakes or the injection of magma which causes slope instability. The reason for this is due to energy stored in material within the avalanche. Some large avalanches have been known to carry blocks as large as three kilometers in length, several kilometers from their source. Such avalanches can travel close to 300 km/hr (Francis, 1993)! Landslide is a general term for mass movement.
how long do canada geese incubate eggs	Every hour, they stand up, rotate the eggs, push them together with their feet, and settle down to continue incubation. (Betsy flipping her eggs). Incubation lasts about 25-30 days. Most Canada geese remain on their nests for 23 out of 24 hours, taking short nesting breaks to stretch and feed. Others may take longer nest breaks lasting up to an hour or more. They're a lot of fun to watch when they take nesting breaks. The eggs could have been laid by an immature goose who wasn't ready to have a nest this year. A Canada goose egg is about three times the size of a chicken egg and weighs about 5 ounces. Nests are spaced about 30-50 feet from each other and ganders patrol their territory, seldom venturing into other gander territories.Incubation Duration. Incubating goose eggs should be done for a period of about 28 days for smaller breeds, and up to 35 days for larger breeds before pipping begins. Once goose eggs begin hatching, the process can take up to three days before they are completely out of their shell. Incubation Humidity. Goose eggs require unique humidity settings from other types of hatching eggs. You will want to maintain a 50-55% humidity for the first 27 days, then an increase to 75% for the remaining days. There are many different ways that you can help to increase the humidity.
what is ear fluid imbalance	A balance disorder is a disturbance that causes an individual to feel unsteady, giddy, woozy, or have a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. An organ in our inner ear, the labyrinth, is an important part of our vestibular (balance) system. The labyrinth interacts with other systems in the body, such as the visual (eyes) and skeletal (bones and joints) systems, to maintain the body's position. Motion of the fluid tells us if we are moving. The semicircular canals and the visual and skeletal systems have specific functions that determine an individual's orientation. The vestibule is the region of the inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea (the hearing organ).Labyrinthitis-an infection or inflammation of the inner ear causing dizziness and loss of balance.

why are greenhouse gases important	A greenhouse gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be about 15 °C (27 °F) colder than the present average of 14 °C (57 °F). Some trap more heat than others. For example, one pound of methane traps about 21 times as much heat as one pound of carbon dioxide. Learn more. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas emitted by humans, but several other gases contribute to climate change, too. Learn more about the major greenhouse gases by selecting pieces of the pie chart below. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, which makes the Earth warmer. People are adding several types of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and each gas's effect on climate change depends on three main factors: People produce larger amounts of some greenhouse gases than others. Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas you hear people talk about the most. That's because we produce more carbon dioxide than any other greenhouse gas, and it's responsible for most of the warming

which taste is stimulated by alkaloids	Taste. As shown to the right, each taste bud consists of a cluster of sensory cells forming synapses with neurons with long axons. These project to the medulla in one of three cranial nerves (VII,IX,X). The sensory cells release glutamate when stimulated by their corresponding taste. Scattered over the tongue, there are five classical types of taste buds: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Salt and sweet are self-explanatory. The bitter respond to various plant alkaloids, sour to acid (such as might be found in spoiled foods), and the umami to glutamate and some related substances. Sensing of amino acids by the gut-expressed taste receptor T1R1-T1R3 stimulates CCK secretion. Daly K, Al-Rammahi M, Moran A, Marcello M, Ninomiya Y, Shirazi-Beechey SP. CCK is secreted by endocrine cells of the proximal intestine in response to dietary components, including amino acids. CCK plays a variety of roles in digestive processes, including inhibition of food intake, consistent with a role in satiety. In the lingual epithelium, the sensing of a broad spectrum of L-amino acids is accomplished by the heteromeric amino acid (umami) taste receptor (T1R1-T1R3). T1R1 and T1R3 subunits are also expressed in the intestine. A defining characteristic of umami sensing by T1R1-T1R3 is its potentiation by IMP or GMP
what is the smallest muscle in the human body and is not striped	The size of the stapes, compared with a 10-cent euro coin. The stapes is the third bone of the three ossicles in the middle ear. The stapes is a stirrup-shaped bone, and the smallest in the human body. It rests on the oval window, to which it is connected by an annular ligament. The stapes is described as having a base, resting on the oval window, as well as a head that articulates with the incus. The stapes /ˈsteɪpiːz/ is a bone in the middle ear of humans and other mammals which is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear. The stirrup-shaped small bone is on and transmits these to the oval window, medially. The stapes is the smallest and lightest named bone in the human body, and is so-called because of its resemblance to a stirrup (Latin: Stapes)The Biggest, Smallest, Longest, and Strongest Skeletal Muscles in the Human Body. The skeletal muscles are the striped, voluntary, powerfully and quickly contracting muscles. They are near the skin and are quite bulky. The Body's Bulkiest Muscle. The biggest (bulkiest) of the skeletal muscles is the Gluteus maximus-the buttock muscle. It is a very superficial and prominent muscle. In humans it is bigger than that of chimpanzees and gorillas.

how to stop someone climbing over your wall	Get some cement, paste it along the top of your wall, then get some thick broken glass and securely fit it in. Make sure you supervise the wall until it's dry and set, because bits could fall into your garden etc. They keep climbing the wall and kicking their footballs over several times a day. They've knocked my two year old son off his slide, ruined plants, and covered my washing in mud from their footballs. But when I ask them to stop they get cheeky and answer me back.The method you choose to use to keep people from climbing on the block wall will depend on the severity of the threat the climbers pose. If neighborhood children are climbing over the wall or vandalizing the property, place a permanent, non-harming barrier if possible. Instructions. Plant thick and prickly shrubs surrounding the perimeter of the walls to make them less accessible. Good choices include rose and hawthorn bushes. Paint the wall with anti-climbing paint. Check with your local council to determine the legal restrictions of using anti-climbing paint. Anti-climbing paint leaves an oily and slippery surface on the wall that is extremely difficult to climb. Add barbed wire or anti-climbing spikes to the upper ledge of the wall to discourage climbers. Anti-climbing spikes are attached to the top of a wall using cement
what is development as geography definition	Development geography is a branch of geography which refers to the standard of living and quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. In development geography, geographers study spatial patterns in development. They try to find by what characteristics they can measure development by looking at economic, political and social factors. They seek to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development.1 GNP per capita is a country's GNP divided by its population.

how to keep the humidity in an incubator overnight	If, after 6 days, you do not see life or development in any of the eggs, then terminate incubation. Most of the time, a power outage will delay hatching by a few days and decrease the hatchability to 40-50 percent. Humidity The relative humidity of the air within an incubator should be about 60 percent. The key is to keep the eggs as warm as possible until the power returns. This can be done by placing a large cardboard box or blankets over the top of small incubators for additional insulation. To warm the eggs, place candles in jars, light them and place the jars under the box that covers the incubator.Humidity is carefully controlled to prevent unnecessary loss of egg moisture. The relative humidity in the incubator between setting and three days prior to hatching should remain at 58-60% or 84-86 degree F., wet-bulb. When hatching, the humidity is increased to 65% relative humidity or more. An excellent method to determine correct humidity is to candle the eggs at various stages of incubation. In a still-air incubator, where the eggs are turned by hand, it may be helpful to place an X on one side of each egg and an O on the other side, using a pencil. This serves as an aide to determine whether all eggs are turned. When turning, be sure your hands are free of all greasy or dusty substances.

who invented the first sewing machine	He patented the first practical sewing machine in 1846. In 1846, the idea of a sewing machine was nothing new. The first patents for such a machine had been granted in England in 1755, in Austria in 1819, the U.S. in 1826 and France in 1830..Early sewing machines were designed for industrial applications. But in 1846 Elias Howe changed all that, he came up with another way to make clothes, he patented the first practical sewing machine..The sewing machine industry based on his original invention made possible the mass production of clothing on a much larger scale than had ever been possible with hand-stitching.The first sewing machine was invented in the United States by Walter Hunt from New York. Hunt never obtained a patent. Later, Elias Howe, from Massachusetts, invented the fi … rst automatic sewing machine. Howe did receive a patent for his invention. Elias Howe was employed in a machinist's shop, where h … e had the opportunity to experiment with inventing a sewing machine. He successfully demonstrated his first sewing machine in 1846, and patented his lockstitch sewing machine on 10 September 1846 in New Hartford, Connecticut. Howe faced a legal battle after Isaac Singer invented the up-and-down motion mechanism, and Allen Wilson developed a rotary hook shuttle, both filing for patents
what is a monistic society	Home Religion Monistic Religion. Monism is the metaphysical view that all is of one essential essence, substance or energy. Monism is to be distinguished from dualism, which holds that ultimately there are two kinds of substance, and from pluralism, which holds that ultimately there are many kinds of substance. Monism is often seen in relation to pantheism, panentheism, and an immanent God. A subcategory of eliminativism is radical behaviourism, a view held by B. F. Skinner.) Anomalous monism, a position proposed by Donald Davidson in the 1970s as a way to resolve the Mind-body problem. It could be considered (by the above definitions) either physicalism or neutral monism.Another distinction is the difference between substance and existence monism, or stuff monism and thing monism. Substance monism posits that only one kind of stuff (e.g. matter or mind) exists, although many things may be made out of this stuff. Existence monism posits that, strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing (e.g. the universe), which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things. 1 Partial monism, within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance. 2  Existence monism, the view that there is only one concrete object token (The One, τὸ ἕν or the Monad).
what is the importance of greek cases	There are four different case forms in Greek. The four cases are Nominative, Genitive, Dative, and Accusative. Following is a discussion of these four different cases. There is another case not included in the four main noun cases because it is so closely related to the nominative: the Vocative. Likewise a noun that is in the predicate part of a sentence containing a linking verb should also be in the nominative case. For example: Christ loved the church and gave Himself for her (Eph 5:25). The word Christ is in the nominative case in Greek and is therefore the subject of this sentence. Galatians 5:22 says: But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, .... As the subject of the sentence, the Greek word for fruit is in the nominative casOf course, the Greek article very often, but definitely not always, functions as an individualizing article, where it is used to distinguish one entity — one person, one group of persons, one thing, or one group of things — apart from all other entities. 1 Next, repeat all the previous steps for the feminine article and 1st declension case endings, then repeat them for the neuter article and the 2nd declension neuter case endings, then repeat them again for the 3rd declension case endings. 2  If the case ending is nothing, type in a dash (-).
when checking your temperature under the arm what is normal	Normal range runs between 97 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 36.0-37.7 degrees Celsius. Ear temperature (or tympanic temperature) also is very accurate in children and adults. 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) is the normal temperature for this method. Measuring body temperature orally is perhaps the most traditional means of measurement. Although 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the standard norm, healthy range can vary between 98.2 and 98.8 degrees (36.7-37.1 degrees Celsius).

what other processes in the body cells require atp	ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. It is one of the end products of photophosphorylation, cellular respiration, and fermentation and used by enzymes and structural proteins in many cellular processes, including biosynthetic reactions, motility, and cell division. ATP is therefore continuously recycled in organisms: the human body, which on average contains only 250 grams (8.8 oz) of ATP, turns over its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day. ATP is used as a substrate in signal transduction pathways by kinases that phosphorylate proteins and lipidsMitochondria are the energy factories of the cells. The energy currency for the work that animals must do is the energy-rich molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The ATP is produced in the mitochondria using energy stored in food. Just as the chloroplasts in plants act as sugar factories for the supply of ordered molecules to the plant, the mitochondria in animals and plants act to produce the ordered ATP molecules as the energy supply for the processes of life. So the cell will have a lot of structures that are capable of producing a high amount of available energy. This ATP production by the mitochondria is done by the process of respiration, which in essence is the use of oxygen in a process which generates energy.

where is dolphin habitat	Fast Facts. Size: The familiar bottlenose dolphin is around 8 feet (2.5m) long and weighs between 440-660 lbs (200-300kg). Because the forty species of dolphins are so diverse, they range in size. The smallest of the dolphin species, Maui's Dolphin, is around 4 feet (1.2m) long and weighs around 90 lbs (40 kg). The largest dolphin species is the orca, or killer whale. Male orcas grow to about 25 feet in length and weigh about 19,000 pounds. Lifespan: Most dolphins live long lives. The bottlenose dolphin can live over 40 years, and the orca can live to be 70 or 80!Dolphins tend to like areas that have warmer temperatures too. However, sometimes they are found in colder water due to the need for food. It is very interesting to see some places where they live. Studies show that the habitat of the dolphin is quite diversified due to environmental factors and food accessibility. They are very smart creatures and have the intelligence to modify their habitat when possible for survival. For example, the Bottlenose Dolphin is found in all of the oceans. Some of the dolphins out there are found in much smaller habitat locations. For example, the Yangtze River Dolphin is primarily found in freshwater around the Yangtze River in China. Hector’s Dolphins are found around the coastal areas of New Zealand

what does beef do for your body biology	Humans have evolved to eat meat, including beef, so the human body comes equipped with specialized enzymes that break down the tough proteins and fats in beef. But beef is harder for the body to digest than plant foods, because it's entirely protein and fat. Both of these are more difficult for the body to break down than carbohydrates, the primary macronutrient in plant foods. Your body begins breaking down your food when you take your first bite. The mashing of your teeth starts to break the beef down into smaller pieces, creating more surface area for gastric, intestinal and pancreatic juices and specialized enzymes to do their work. Early Stages of Digestion. Your body begins breaking down your food when you take your first bite. The mashing of your teeth starts to break the beef down into smaller pieces, creating more surface area for gastric, intestinal and pancreatic juices and specialized enzymes to do their work.The Power of Protein.

what food is glucose in	After 50 grams of available carbohydrates have been consumed, blood sugar levels are measured over a period of 2 hours. The results are plotted on a graph and summarized in what is called glucose AUC, or area under the curve.. Glucose AUC shows the immediate impact of the food on our blood sugar. Measuring GI also requires a second step. In this second step, 50 grams of available carbohydrate are consumed, but this time the food involved is one of two reference foods: either white bread or pure sugar (glucose). Dried fruits are very high in glucose. Photo Credit udra/iStock/Getty Images. Glucose is one of the simplest types of sugar and the main source of energy your body uses. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells are able to pull in glucose from your bloodstream to use as fuel. Nearly all carbohydrate-containing foods, from fruits to breads, have some level of glucose, although fruits are usually the highest sources. Since glucose can elevate your blood sugar quickly, if you are diabetic, you may want to avoid regularly consuming foods high in glucose. Typically all types of fruits have some level of glucose.

sql why is transaction logs important	Advanced Information. The transaction log for any database is managed as a set of virtual log files (VLFs). SQL Server determines VLF file sizes internally based on the total size of the log file and the growth increment that is used when the log expands. A log always expands in units of whole VLFs and it can only compress to a VLF boundary. Log records in the transaction log files are truncated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. If the transaction scope is large, that transaction and any transactions started after it are not removed from the transaction log unless it is completed. This can result in large log files.A transaction log is a file – integral part of every SQL Server database. It contains log records produced during the logging process in a SQL Server database. The transaction log is the most important component of a SQL Server database when it comes to the disaster recovery – however, it must be uncorrupted. After each database modification – transaction occurrence, a log record is written to the transaction log. All the changes are written sequentially. A transaction log stores every transaction made to a SQL Server database, except some which are minimally logged like BULK IMPORT or SELECT INTO. Internally it is split into the smaller parts called Virtual Log Files (VLFs).

how long after cold or flu are you contagious?	The typical flu incubation period is between 24 hours and four days, with the average being two days. This means that if you are exposed to the influenza virus and become infected, you will start to experience flu symptoms anywhere between 24 hours and four days after the exposure. Another factor that contributes to how the flu spreads is when exactly you may be contagious. Unlike many common illnesses that are only contagious when you're experiencing symptoms, the flu can be contagious 24 hours before your symptoms appear, so you're likely out there spreading the virus before you ever know that you have it.So, when are you most contagious? Most experts agree that adults with a cold or the flu start being contagious about a day before they start experiencing symptoms. For the flu, the contagious period then lasts five to seven days into the illness. For children, the contagious period for the flu can last up to two weeks after they start feeling sick, even if they start feeling better before that. The contagious period for a cold lasts about three to four days into the illness. As a general rule, people with a cold are most contagious about three days after their initial exposure to the virus.

what are the ojibwa beliefs	Ojibwa religion was very much an individual affair and centered on the belief in power received from spirits during dreams and visions. For this reason, dreams and visions were accorded great significance and much effort was given to their interpretation. For the Ojibwa the supernatural world held a multitude of spiritual beings and forces. Some of these beings and forces—Sun, Moon, Four Winds, Thunder, and Lightning—were benign, but others—ghosts, witches, and Windigo, a supernatural cannibalistic giant—were malevolent and feared.The Ojibwe (also Ojibwa), or Chippewa are a large group of Native Americans and First Nations in North America. There are Ojibwe communities in both Canada and the United States. In Canada, they are the second-largest population among First Nations, surpassed only by the Cree. In the United States, they have the fourth-largest population among Native American tribes, surpassed only by the Navajo, Cherokee, and Lakota. Ojibwe who were originally located along the Mississagi River and made their way to southern Ontario are known as the Mississaugas. The Ojibwe Peoples are a major component group of the Anishinaabe-speaking peoples, a branch of the Algonquian language family.

normal resting heart rate by age	In newborn infants up to one year old, 100 to 160 bpm is normal. Children between one and 10 years old range from 70 to 120 bpm. After the age of 10, up to adults and seniors, 60 to 100 bpm are considered normal, often centered on 72 as a benchmark for healthy, resting adults. Physiologists at Montana State University report resting heart rates of 28 to 40 bpm. More common rates for most athletes range between the low 40s and low 50s. Normal athletic heart rates are low because athletes' heart muscles are so strong, a single beat pumps more than a normal amount of blood.For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the person’s physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA. But a heart rate lower than 60 doesn’t necessarily mean you have a medical problem. Active people often have lower heart rates because their heart muscles don't need to work as hard to maintain a steady beat. A normal heart rate depends on the individual, age, body size, heart conditions, whether the person is sitting or moving, medication use and even air temperature. Even emotions can have an impact on heart rate. For example, getting excited or scared can increase the
which type of diabetes is worse?	Diabetes (otherwise known as diabetes mellitus, DM) is described as a metabolic disorder in which the body cannot properly store and use the energy found in food. More specifically, diabetes is a condition that affects the body's ability to use glucose (a type of sugar) as fuel. Glucose is a form of carbohydrate that comes from foods such as breads, cereals, pasta, rice, potatoes, fruits and some vegetables. When blood glucose levels get too high (hyperglycemia) this can cause damage to the tiny blood vessels in the eyes, kidneys, heart and nervous system, which is why diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, loss of vision and neurological conditions.medically speaking, type 1 is worse, because the pancreas shuts down, whereas in type 2, the pancreas simply functions improperly. However, as a type 1 diabetic patient, I can tell you that Type 1 is BAD. through constant glucose checks and insulin injections, it is a lot to manage and sometimes quite a hassle. Type 2 diabetics have the problem of having insulin resistance. Yes, their pancreas's still produce insulin, but that does not mean that their body is receiving it. Like type 1's they also have to maintain a strict diet and exercise regularly, but their health is not completely up to them.

It can cause a person to be more likely to donate a large amount of money to charity, but also cause them to be more likely to engage in mob violence. Deindividuation theory seeks to provide an explanation for a variety of antinormative collective behavior, such as violent crowds, lynch mobs, etc. Deindividuation theory has also been applied to genocide and been posited as an explanation for antinormative behavior online and in computer-mediated communications.Deindividuation is a concept in social psychology that is generally thought of as the loss of self-awareness in groups, although this is a matter of contention (see below). Sociologists also study the phenomenon of deindividuation, but the level of analysis is somewhat different. For the social psychologist, the level of analysis is the individual in the context of a social situation. Deindividuation theory seeks to provide an explanation for a variety of antinormative collective behavior, such as violent crowds, lynch mobs, etc. Deindividuation theory has also been applied to genocide and been posited as an explanation for antinormative behavior online and in computer-mediated communications.
is trna an enzyme	1 Roles of mRNA, tRNA, rRNA. 2  mRNA (messenger RNA): contains codons that code for the peptide sequence. 3  tRNA (transfer RNA): contains the anticodon on the tip and the corresponding amino acid on the tail. 4  Link the correct amino acid to its corresponding mRNA codon through codon-anticodon interaction. 1 Both tRNA (transfer RNA) and rRNA (ribosomal RNA) are products of transcription. 2  However, they do not serve as the template of translation. 3  tRNA is responsible for bringing in the correct amino acid during translation. 4  rRNA makes up the ribosome, which is the enzyme responsible forThere are many different types of tRNA and each tRNA is recognised by a tRNA-activating enzyme. This enzyme binds a specific amino acid to the tRNA by using ATP as an energy source. The tRNA molecule has a specific structure. It contains double stranded sections (due to base pairing via hydrogen bonds) and loops. It has an anticodon loop which contains the anticodon and two other loops. Each enzyme will attach a specific amino acid to the tRNA which has the matching anticodon for that amino acid. When the amino acid binds to the tRNA molecule a high energy bond is created. The energy from this bond is used later on to bind the amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain during translation. Summary:

what did the anglo saxons wear	Anglo-Saxons' clothing usually utilized only three types of fabric. Wool was a coarse material which was used for most garments. Lower-class people, such as slaves (theow) and poorer peasants (gebur) could only use wool for their garments, even garments worn against the skin. For the poorer theow, this would be the only clothing worn, although some may have been given woolen trousers and shoes to wear. Gebur would be able to afford woolen trousers and leather shoes, and would also carry a knife (called a seax), which signified their freedom in the eyes of medieval Anglo-Saxon society.5th to 7th centuries. Women wore an under-dress of linen or wool with long sleeves and a draw-string neck. Sleeves were fastened with clasps for wealthier women, or drawn together with braid or string for poorer women. The outer dress was a tube of material, rather like a pinafore, and often called a ‘peplos’. Cloaks were now rectangular with a hole cut out for the head, and held in place with a belt. Children seem to have worn very much the same style of clothing as adults, but in smaller sizes. Making clothes was women’s work, and spinning and weaving were among the main activities of women in the Anglo-Saxon period. It has been estimated that about eight miles of hand-spun thread were needed to make a tunic
why does temperature affect heart rate	Cardiac output can be increased by increasing the heart rate. Thus an increase in temperature, through the vasodilation of blood vessels causes a drop in blood pressure, which is compensated for by increasing the cardiac output, which can be achieved through increasing the heart rate. Heart rates tend to be lower in the morning. Heart rate increases  at high temperatures. Dehydration causes an increase in heart rate.  Heart rate during running varies by a … few beats from day-to-day.  Training heart rate does not predict racingBest Answer: In heat gain, heart rate increases as the result of changes in the core body temperature. Dressing appropriately is the most important consideration to maintain the bodies core temperature. Dehydration causes heart rate to increase. In heat loss, heart rate decreases as adjustments result in improved exercise capacity to heat exposure but minimally to cold stress. This generally takes about 10 days. Shivering can increase the heart rate significantly to increase core temperature. Report Abuse. Unless the temperature is so hot or so cold that it is shocking or painful, temperature really doesn't affect your heart rate directly Oxygen content in the air is affected by temperature sometimes. For example, room temperature atmosphere usually holds 22% oxygen.

what is the normal range for neutrophils	The ANC is found by multiplying the WBC count by the percent of neutrophils in the blood. For instance, if the WBC count is 8,000 and 50% of the WBCs are neutrophils, the ANC is 4,000 (8,000 × 0.50 = 4,000). When the ANC drops below 1,000 it is called neutropenia (new-truh-peen-e-uh). Your doctor will watch your ANC closely because the risk of infection is much higher when the ANC is below 500. There are many types of white blood cells and each fights infection in a special way. The most important infection-fighting WBC is the neutrophil (new-truh-fil). The number doctors look at is called your absolute neutrophil count (ANC). A healthy person has an ANC between 2,500 and 6,000.The Basophils should remain within the normal range, generally between 0% and 2%. Some clinicians believe that, as in the case of neutrophils, the absolute basophil count is more important than the percentage of basophils and should fall between 0 to 0.3 k/ul. As with platelets, neutrophil levels may become depressed in patients on myelosuppressive therapy such as imatinib mesylate (also called IM, Gleevec or Glivec). The normal range of the percentage of neutrophils is between 45% and 70%. More important than the percentage of neutrophils is the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) , which should fall between 1.0 to 8.0

The downside to this method of compensation is that their overall salary doesn’t increase and the lump sum payout is typically taxed at 40% because it is considered a bonus. Pay Bands are also regional as well.A pay band is sometimes used to define the range (band) of compensation given for certain roles. The range is based on factors like location (high vs low cost of living locations), experience, or seniority. Pay bands (sometimes also used as a broader term that encompasses several pay levels, ranges or grades) is a part of an organized salary compensation plan, program or system. In an organization that has defined jobs, pay bands are used to distinguish the level of compensation given to certain ranges of jobs. For example, entry level positions at a landscaping company might include truck drivers and laborers. Those jobs and those of similar levels of responsibility might all be included in a named or numbered pay band that prescribed a range of pay, (e.g. Band 1 = $10 - $17 per hour).
what is the driest continent	Antarctica Continent, Antarctica Facts. Antarctica, the third smallest continent in the world after Australia and Europe, covers the earth's South Pole. It lies in the Antarctic Circle and is surrounded by Southern Ocean. It is known as the coldest, windiest, driest and least populous continent of the world. Without any element of doubt, Antarctica is the coldest place on earth where water remains frozen year around. It is a frozen desert with very little precipitation. Antarctica is the coldest and driest of all the continents in the world. Even an ordinary man is quite aware of Antarctica, being the coldest place on the face of this universe. The average annual temperature in Antarctica is 58 degrees.Australia is the driest inhabited continent. Antarctica is the driest of all the continents. This is because in Antarctica it is too cold for the sun to heat up the oceans or … melt the ice, so it will not evaporate. Additionally, cold air (especially below freezing), cannot hold as much water vapor as warmer air.

There really isn't much to say about the soil except that it is real important to plants and the animals that eat the plantsThe abiotic components of a savanna grassland are the nonliving aspects of the grassland ecosystem that the living organisms depend upon. These include climate, soil, topography and natural disturbances. Precipitation is important to a grassland as it determines the amount and types of plants and trees that grow. Soil. Soil has both biotic and abiotic factors in a savanna grassland. The abiotic factors of soil include minerals and texture of the soil that allow for the flow of water. The biotic factors include organic matter, water and air. Plants and trees grow in the soil, and it holds the moisture for them to absorb
cortisol or testosterone are examples of this type of hormone	Cortisol is commonly referred to as  the stress hormone .. The hormone is secreted by the adrenal glands and released into the bloodstream as a fight or flight response to stress. The highest quantities of cortisol are produced in the early morning hours and then production slowly tapers off throughout the day. In some cases, cortisol inhibits the production of insulin, a hormone responsible for metabolic functions and blood sugar regulation. When this happens, the results vary from weight gain to more serious health conditions, such as type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome (syndrome X).This hormone is cortisol, a steroid hormone, and is probably the most underrated of the four bodybuilding hormones overviewed in this article. Cortisol is termed catabolic as it has the opposite effect to testosterone, insulin and growth hormone in that it breaks down tissue. In fact cortisol, which is released by the adrenal glands under conditions of high mental and physical stress and high temperature, is the body's primary catabolic hormone. It is excess cortisol that is the problem for bodybuilders not cortisol per se. The dangers of excess cortisol are: 1  Reduced growth hormone, and testosterone output. 2  Osteoporosis. 3  Reduced muscle and increased abdominal fat. 4  Impaired memory and learning.
what does the small intestine do in the digestive system	Despite its name, the small intestine is the largest part of the digestive tract. Even though the small intestine is only about one inch in diameter, the small intestine is approximately 20 to 23 feet long. Because the small intestine is long, the small intestine has a lot of surface area. This large surface area helps to ensure that the nutrients are absorbed. The small intestine has three parts called the duodenum, the jejuneum, and the ileum. These villi are largest in the duodenum and become smaller as the tube progresses away from the stomach. These villi make the walls of the small intestine look like a shag carpet. On the inside of the villi is a network of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels called a lacteal.Functions of the small intestine. The small intestine is the part of the intestines where 90% of the digestion and absorption of food occurs, the other 10% taking place in the stomach and large intestine. The main function of the small intestine is absorption of nutrients and minerals from food. The small intestine is a tubular structure within the abdominal cavity that carries the food in continuation with the stomach up to the colon from where the large intestine carries it to the rectum and out of the body via the anus. The main function of this organ is to aid in digestion.

what psychologist developed the concept of mental age	Mental age was first defined by the French psychologist Alfred Binet, who introduced the intelligence test in 1905, with the assistance of Theodore Simon. Binet's experiments on French schoolchildren laid the framework for future experiments into the mind throughout the Twentieth Century. However mental age varies according to what kind of intelligence is measured. A child's intellectual age can be average for his physical age but the same child's emotional intelligence can be immature for his physical age. In this psychologists often remark girls are more emotionally mature than boys in the tween years.Mental age is a measure of an individual's mental attainment based on the age in which it takes an average individual to reach that same level of attainment. Mental age is based on your intellectual development, while chronological age is based on your date of birth. There are some who support the concept of mental age, while others believe that it has no value. Knowing a person's mental age can help you develop treatments that are developmentally appropriate. The concept of mental age is somewhat debatable. Those who support mental age believe that even though children develop intellectually at different rates, the path of intellectual development is essentially the same for all children.

what is carburetor for	A carburetor, called a carb for short, is a device used in an internal combustion engine, such as the type found in an automobile. Invented by Karl Benz in the 1800s and patented in 1886, a carburetor’s job is to mix air and fuel. All carburetors follow a basic type of construction. Basically, a carburetor consists of a tube with an adjustable plate across it. This plate is called the throttle plate and controls the amount of airflow. A narrowing in the tube is called the venturi, which creates the carburetor's vacuum.A carburetor (American and Canadian spelling), carburator, carburettor, or carburetter (Commonwealth spelling) is a device that blends air and fuel for an internal combustion engine. It is sometimes colloquially shortened to carb in North America or carby in Australia. To carburate or carburet (and thus carburation or carburetion, respectively) is to blend the air and fuel or to equip (an engine) with a carburetor for that purpose. Carburetors have largely been supplanted in the automotive industry by fuel injection. A carburetor basically consists of an open pipe through which the air passes into the inlet manifold of the engine. The pipe is in the form of a Venturi: it narrows in section and then widens again, causing the airflow to increase in speed in the narrowest part.
how much money physicians make	The data in the report come from more than 19,500 doctors in 26 specialties who responded to Medscape's annual survey with information on their compensation for 2014. The average primary care doctor made $195,000; the average specialist made $284,000. But those averages hide quite a bit of variability based on different factors. The infographic below shows the average earnings for each surveyed specialty. Orthopedists, of whom just 9% are women, were the highest earners: Average physician income ranges from $253,000 in the Northeast to $281,000 in the Northwest. Certain regions of the country may have to pay more to attract doctors, so physician salaries often reflect the level of competition more than the cost of living.Behind the numbers Over a lifetime, the average primary care physician will pocket roughly $6.5 million in income, or about 35% less than the $10 million that specialty physicians earn in their lifetime. That's a lot of money, but the income ranges vary widely depending on a physician's focus. Other top income earners include cardiologists and gastroenterologists, both of whom make more than $370,000 annually. The doctors who get paid the least every year are pediatricians and physicians in family practices. In both cases, those physicians earn an average of less than $20

erwin what does domain value mean	Since x = 2 gives me two possible destinations, then this relation is not a function. Note that all I had to do to check whether the relation was a function was to look for duplicate x-values. If you find a duplicate x-value, then the different y-values mean that you do not have a function. State the domain and range of the following relation. The domain is all the x-values, and the range is all the y-values. To give the domain and the range, I just list the values without duplication: domain: {2, 3, 4, 6}. range: {–3, –1, 3, 6}. (It is customary to list these values in numerical order, but it is not required.Summary: The domain of a function is all the possible input values for which the function is defined, and the range is all possible output values. If you are still confused about domain and range, you might consider posting your question on our message board, or reading another website's lesson on domain and range. What kind of functions don't have a domain of all real numbers? Well, if the domain is the set of all real numbers for which the function is defined, then logically we're looking for a function that has certain input values that do not produce a valid output, i.e., the function is undefined for that input. Here is an example: This function is defined for almost any real x

what a group of muskrats called	Muskrats live in marshes, or alongside ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams. Muskrats build a house, called a lodge, out of aquatic plants, especially cattails. It can be up to eight feet across and five feet high. A muskrat lodge looks a lot like a Beaver lodge. Muskrats also burrow holes in stream or pond banks. At least one entrance hole will always be above the water line. This animal also builds feeding platforms (places to eat) with the same types of materials as the lodge, only much smaller. Denver Division of Animal Control. Muskrats build a house, called a lodge, out of aquatic plants, especially cattails. It can be up to eight feet across and five feet high.Widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category, on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Located in the Southwestern edge of Alberta, the Rocky Mountains are perhaps the best known and most well visited of Alberta's six natural regions. The Rocky Mountains comprise 8 percent of the province. Banff, Canada's first national park, was established in 1885. Soon after, Waterton Lakes National Park was established on the southern end and Jasper National Park on the northern end of Alberta's Rocky Mountain Chain. And, in 1959, the Government of Alberta protected another significant mountain region, Willmore Wilderness Park, just north of Jasper National Park. The foresight of those who set aside these parks ensured that two of the three sub-regions of the Rocky Mountains, the Alpine and Sub-Alpine, are well protected today.
benefits of transpiration in plants	Transpiration is the evaporation of cellular water (in the form of water vapour) from the stoma in the leaves of the plants. Stoma are pores and are generally located on the … underside of the leaves of plants. Water accumulating in the leaves of the plants is lost as water vapor through the process of transpiration, this is similar to the process of sweating in animals. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Perhaps the gratest benefit of transpiration is that it uses solar energy to drive passive movement of water and minerals from soil to leaves. The plant does not expend energy moving this waterTranspiration is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere. Transpiration is essentially evaporation of water from plant leaves. Transpiration also includes a process called guttation, which is the loss of water in liquid form from the uninjured leaf or stem of the plant, principally through water stomata. Studies have revealed that about 10 percent of the moisture found in the atmosphere is released by plants through transpiration. The remaining 90 percent is mainly supplied by evaporation from oceans, seas, and other bodies of water (lakes, rivers, streams).
what does vitamin c injections do	Research on high dose vitamin C injections began in the 1970s when Linus Pauling, a chemist from Oregon State University began his research. New research involved injecting high doses of vitamin C intravenously into human ovarian cells. The tests were conducted in vitro, on mice and in 22 humans subjects. The BBC reports that vitamin C effectively targeted ovarian cancer cells while completely avoiding healthy cells. The benefits of high-dose vitamin C injections were also observed in conjunction with chemotherapy. Some are suggesting that the injections provide a great boost alongside chemo treatment. However chemo does destroy all cells, both healthy and not and is often the cause of death for cancer patienVitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient found in some foods. In the body, it acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are compounds formed when our bodies convert the food we eat into energy. The vitamin C in dietary supplements is usually in the form of ascorbic acid, but some supplements have other forms, such as sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, other mineral ascorbates, and ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids. Research has not shown that any form of vitamin C is better than the other forms.

when was catalytic cracking discovered	“For many refiners, the cat cracker is the key to profitability.” 1 The following is a chronology of developments in fluid catalytic cracking:  1915 Gulf Refining discovered that Aluminum Chloride catalyst could catalytically crack heavy oil.  1936 Natural clays as catalyst greatly improved cracking efficiency. 6 Summary ....................................................................................................................... ............................. 7. 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The concept of fluid catalytic cracking has been around since 1915. It was introduced into the petroleum refining process in 1942. Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is, arguably, the most important petroleum refining process for converting high molecular weight, high boiling point, molecular chains into useful fuel products and gassesBurton’s cracking process used heat to convert complex hydrocarbons (whose molecules contain many carbon atoms) into simpler gasoline hydrocarbons (whose molecules contain fewer carbon atoms), thereby increasing the yield of gasoline from petroleum. Impact. In addition to using thermal cracking to make gasoline for sale, Standard Oil of Indiana also profited by licensing the process for use by other gasoline producers. Soon, the method was used throughout the oil industry.

what causes striated appearances in cardiac and skeletal muscle	The A and I bands repeat along the length of the muscle fibers to create the striations visible under the light microscope. 1  Sarcomeres repeat along skeletal and cardiac fibers. 2  Components between adjacent Z-lines comprise the sarcomere. 3  Sarcomeres are considered the functional units of striated muscles. In views of this muscle type, striations are not as strong as those of skeletal muscle. Other structural features are usually apparent and of use for identification if the striations are weak. Due to constant activity cardiac muscle has a constant need for oxygen and glucose delivery.The myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments, repeated in units called sarcomeres, the basic functional units of the muscle fiber. The sarcomere is responsible for the striated appearance of skeletal muscle, and forms the basic machinery necessary for muscle contraction. The term muscle refers to multiple bundles of muscle fibers called fascicles. All muscles also contain connective tissue arranged in layers of fasciae. It is one of three major muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers known as tendons. Skeletal muscle is made up of individual muscle cells or myocytes, known as muscle fibers.
how much does a rehab center cost	Figuring Out How Much You'll Pay. The cost of a rehab program depends on a number of factors, such as what kind of treatment you choose, where it's located and how long you stay. Inpatient can range from $2,000 - $25,000 for a 30-day program. Outpatient can range from free to $10,000. Detox can range from $300-$800 a day. Keep in mind that the cost of treatment will likely outweigh the cost of an addiction in the long run. A good way to look at the cost of an inpatient rehab program is in terms of the level of care: basic, standard and premium/luxury. Inpatient programs can last anywhere from 30 days to 60 days to 90 days or longer.The cost of luxury drug rehab programs is high because of the many additional services that these facilities offer. However, the cost of standard drug and alcohol treatment programs is much less expensive because these programs focus less on luxury and only on providing patients with drug and alcohol treatment. Standard drug treatment facilities cost between $10,000 and $20,000 per month. Most patients who need these services can afford to pay for them, and they don't mind spending tens of thousands of dollars per month for what they want or need. Ultra-luxury and luxury treatment facilities are the most expensive, averaging between $20,000 to $80,000 monthly.

The noun or noun phrase that would be the object of an active sentence (such as Our troops defeated the enemy) appears as the subject of a sentence with passive voice (e.g. The enemy was defeated by our troops). A sentence featuring the passive voice is sometimes called a passive sentence, and a verb phrase in passive voice is sometimes called a passive verb. English allows a number of passive constructions which are not possible in many of the other languages with similar passive formation.Passive and Active Voices.

In the active voice, the subject and verb relationship is straightforward: the subject is a be-er or a do-er and the verb moves the sentence along. In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is neither a do-er or a be-er, but is acted upon by some other agent or by something unnamed (The new policy was approved). The passive forms of a verb are created by combining a form of the to be verb with the past participle of the main verb. Other helping verbs are also sometimes present: The measure. in committee.. The passive can be used, also, in various tenses.

what are ethical duties of the nurse	Professional Responsibilities. A nurse also has a number of ethical responsibilities relating to the profession of nursing and her specialty. One key responsibility is to always strive to improve both health care environments and conditions of employment to maximize the quality of health care delivery. A nurse must respect the dignity and value of patients and colleagues, and treat all persons equally regardless of personal attributes or medical condition. Related to this is the responsibility to always respect the patient's right to self-determination in her medical care.Another area of ethical concern is the nurse’s responsibility for ensuring that patients have access to care. The values associated with nursing practice include nurse advocacy, respect for humans and eliminating barriers to care. The fact that the patient is incarcerated is only a circumstance of his or her situation and does not, and should not, change how the nurse practices or how the nurse views the patient. Correctional nursing allows the nurse to practice the essence of nursing while recognizing that all patients have intrinsic value. Achieving and staying true to professional nursing values while practicing in the correctional setting can create a unique set of ethical, legal and professional issues for the nurs

how much carbohydrate does an elderly person need	Moderately active women between the ages of 19 and 30 should try to eat 2,000 to 2,200 calories per day. As carbohydrates should account for 900 to 1,430 of these calories, you should eat 225 to 357.5 grams of carbs each day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, these values decrease to 2,000 calories and between 225 and 325 grams of carbs every day. Sedentary women between the ages of 19 and 30 should consume between 1,800 and 2,000 calories per day. Carbohydrates should account for 810 to 1,300 of your calories each day. As there are 4 calories in 1 gram of carbohydrates, this amounts to 202.5 to 325 grams of carbohydrates per day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, you should consume 1,800 calories per day and 202.5 to 292.5 grams of carbohydratesHow much dietary fiber do I need? The recommended dietary fiber intake is 14 grams per 1,000 calories consumed. For example, if you're a sedentary older woman who needs 1,600 calories a day, you should be aiming for 22 grams of dietary fiber a day. Foods containing carbohydrates are part of a healthful diet because they provide dietary fiber, sugars, and starches that help the body function well. The sugars and starches in foods supply energy to the body in the form of glucose, which is used to fuel your brain and nervous system.
average pulse for child	For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the person’s physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA. But a heart rate lower than 60 doesn’t necessarily mean you have a medical problem. Active people often have lower heart rates because their heart muscles don't need to work as hard to maintain a steady beat. A person's target heart rate zone is between 50 percent and 85 percent of his or her maximum heart rate, according to the AHA. Most commonly, maximum heart rate is calculate by subtracting your age from 220: 1  220 - Age. 2  For a 30-year-old person, for example: 220 - 30 = 190.Heart rate tends to decrease across childhood up to adolescence. Age norms for resting heart rate are available at We Be Fit. There is significant variability in children’s heart rates even within age groups. Newborns have heart rates that range from 100 to 160 beats per minute (bpm). Children from ages 1 to 10 have heart rates than range from 60 to 140, and average from 85 to 90. Children who are 11 to 17 have heart rates that range from 60 to 100 bpm. Just as with adults, female children tend to have slightly higher resting higher heart rates than male
where are your muscles located	This is a very broad question. There are so many muscles within the body. There are muscles wherever movement is. There is muscles in the cheeks that are known as the buccal muscle. Then there are muscles in the arm, which are i.e.: deltoid, triceps, biceps. Then in the chest you have a muscle known as the pectoral. In the torso, you also have muscles known as the abdominal, then muscles in the pelvic floor. In the legs you have the calf, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, minimus, soleilus, and so on. These are just a few of the muscles that are located in your body. Then there are also muscles that will hold up various organs such as ligaments and tendons, and then also ones where there are internal functions such as peristalsis such as the sphincterThe largest muscle in the human body is the gluteus maximus. The gluteus maximus is located in your buttocks and its size directly corresponds to the important role it has in your everyday life. It’s main function is to keep your body erect and straight. If by strongest you mean “ability to exert a force on an external object”, then a human’s strongest muscle is his or her ‘ masseter ‘ muscle. The masseter muscle is a thick muscle in the cheek and is located at the back of the jaw. It’s responsible for opening and closing your jaw during chewing
average price for a pool heater repair	1 According to HomeAdvisor.com, the average cost nationwide to repair a swimming pool heater is about $400 to $600. 2  Based on the type of repair and local pricing, however, actual repair costs could be significantly higher or lower. 3  A recommended annual pool heater tune-up costs $100 to $200. Heated pools allow for a longer swimming season than non-heated pools, but they have a higher cost of ownership. In addition to the fuel needed to run a swimming pool heater (at least if it’s electric or gas; free-energy solar heaters are also available), mechanical upkeep is also required.New gas swimming pool heaters have a standard test they go through to determine their energy efficiency based on their Btu (British thermal unit) output. Heater efficiency is the ratio of usable output to energy input. For example, an 80%-efficient heater uses $80 worth of useful heat for every $100 worth of fuel. Therefore, it wastes 20% of the fuel. Most gas pool heaters feature their efficiency percentage on their nameplates. A pool heater's manufacturer can also provide its efficiency percentage. Today, you'll find some gas pool heaters with 89%–95% efficiency. The following table shows how much you can save for every $1,000 in annual pool heating costs by installing a gas pool heater that's 95% efficien

how much carbohydrates starches should a child eat per day	Dietary Fiber. Fiber is included in the daily intake of total carbohydrates, but it also has separate guidelines to ensure children get an adequate amount. From the ages of 1 to 3 years, all children need 19 grams of fiber daily. They should consume 25 grams daily between the ages of 4 to 8 years. At the age of 9, boys need 31 grams of fiber daily, and when they turn 14, their requirement increases to 38 grams. Girls should consume 26 grams of fiber daily from age 9 to 18. Starches are healthy complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, vegetables, beans and fruits. They break down more slowly during digestion, so they provide long-term energy and have less impact on blood sugar. Children who are 2 to 3 years old need 1 cup each of fruits and vegetables and 3 ounces of grains daily.Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs. Percent of Calories. According to the Institute of Medicine, children and adults should consume 45 to 65 percent of their calorie intake as carbohydrates, and at least 130 grams of carbs per day.

what makes a maritime forest unique	Maritime Hammock Habitats. Maritime hammocks, also known as maritime forests, tropical hammocks or coastal hammocks, are characterized as narrow bands of forest that develop almost exclusively on stabilized backdunes of barrier islands, inland of primary dunes and scrub. Because maritime forests occur on the most stable areas of barrier islands, they are attractive building sites. Clearing lots for houses involves disturbing or destroying most, if not all, the natural vegetative cover to make space for homes, parking areas, drainage fields, and septic systems.Maritime forests are composed of deciduous, coniferous, and broadleaf evergreens. Some of the trees that occupy maritime forests include the southern sugar maple, swamp dogwood, mockernut hickory, white ash, and the white poplar. Some animals that live in these forests are: foxes, deer, rabbits, tree frogs, raccoons, toads, painted buntings, and many others. A maritime forest is an ocean coastal wooded habitat found on higher ground than dune areas within range of salt spray. They can be found along the Atlantic and Pacific Northwest coasts of the United States. Also, there are parts of it in areas of South-East Asia, for example Chek Jawa, a wetland reserve which also features a maritime forest as one of the independent ecosystem

turkey incubation temperature	I don’t add any water at all in the incubator for this time period. You shouldn’t have to unless you are in an extremely dry part of the country with very low humidity below 50%. If you run your incubator in an air conditioned room you may have to add water if your humidity is below 50% in the room. These thermometers are the same kind you use to insert into whole roasting poultry to take the internal temperature reading. If your incubator has an auto egg turner place the eggs in the holders large end up. Otherwise just lay them on their sides and turn them over completely to the other side at least 3 times a day.The incubation period for turkey eggs is 28 days. Incubation Temperature. The temperature in the incubator for turkey eggs is 99-99.5 degrees fahrenheit. Humidity Levels. The humidity level (wet bulb thermometer) for turkey eggs is 83-86 degrees fahrenheit. Final Day Of Egg Rotation. The final day of egg rotation for turkey eggs is day 25. Please note that all of this information is only a guide and that this information may differ according to the incubator manufacturer’s guide. If you haven’t an incubator, your chances of hatching them ok and well are slim. They need to be kept at 90degrees F with a humidity of 50-70% they need to be turned twice a day for the first 25 days.
what kind of bonds hold nucleotides together	See Fig. 1. The nucleotides within each strand are held together by the phosphodiester bonds between the 5' carbon of one nucleotide and the 3 ' carbon of the adjacent nucleotdie. These strong covalent bonds form the the glue that holds the sugar/phosphate backbone together and thus act to keep each strand together. The two strands of DNA are held together by weak hydrogen bonds (remember, something must hold them together!) between the nitrogenous bases. The interesting (and very important) aspect of the Watson-Crick model is that these hydrogen bonds are base specific. That is, A (adenine) can only form hydrogen bonds with T (thymine) and C (cytosine) can only form bonds with G (guanine). This means, that if you know the sequence of bases of one strand, you know the sequence of bases of the other strand. The strands is such a molecule are said to be complementary.The type of chemical bonds that hold the parts of each nucleotide  together is a hydrogen bond. It connects each nitrogenous base of  nucleotide in DNA and RNA. Covalent bonding holds CuCl2 together. Covalent bonding is a shared electron pairing of electrons from a non-metal and a metal. For the sake of your chemistry professor's sani … ty please memorize the metals and nonmetals on the periodic table. In fact just memeorize

The snow leopard, is a medium large cat native to the mountain ranges of Central Asia.  Snow leopards live between 3,000 and 5,500 metres (9,800 and 18,000 ft) above sea le … vel in the rocky mountain ranges of Central Asia.Snow leopards live in the high, rugged mountains of Central Asia – in a cold and dry climate. While their habitat range covers 2 million km2 (approximately the size of Greenland or Mexico) , there are only between 4,000 to 6,500 snow leopards left in the wild. the snow leopard range. Their habitat extends through twelve countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. China is one of the most influential countries for our conservation efforts, as it contains as much as 60% of all snow leopard habitat areas. In the Himalayas, snow leopards are usually found between 3,000 and 5,400 meters above sea level. In Mongolia and Russia, these cats are found at lower altitudes of 1000 meters. At the snow leopard’s typical elevation, the climate is cold and dry, and only grasses and small shrubs can grow on the steep mountain slopes.
what is caulk	Traditional caulking (also spelled calking) on wooden vessels uses fibers of cotton and oakum (hemp fiber soaked in pine tar). These fibers are driven into the wedge-shaped seam between planks, with a caulking mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a caulking iron. Caulk can refer either to the caulking substance or to the process of applying it. Caulking as a term has spread to the building trade, meaning the activity of closing up joints and gaps in buildings. The function of caulking is to provide thermal insulation, control water penetration and noise mitigation.Save. Caulk is a non-structural, physical compound that provides an airtight, watertight, or non-porous seal. The seal or closure made by caulk is used to prevent something, such as air, water, gas, liquid, or steam, from entering or escaping between two other materials. Caulk is used to seal joints or spaces between those two materials whether they are similar in substance or not. People have used caulk for centuries. What It's Made Of. Caulk is made of materials that have been used for centuries and newer chemical substances created through the advances of modern science. You may recognize it in many forms such as the chinking used between logs on a log cabin to the rubbery substance that surrounds a shower enclosure.
which believed caliph should be chosen by consensus	Sunni Muslims accept the first four Caliphs (including Ali) as the “rightly guided” rulers who followed the Prophet. In theory, Sunnis believe that the leader (imam) of the Muslim community should be selected on the basis of communal consensus, on the existing political order, and on a leader’s individual merits. This premise has been inconsistently practiced within the Sunni Muslim community throughout history. This situation was unacceptable to some of Ali’s followers, who considered Abu Bakr and the next two succeeding caliphs (Umar and Uthman) to be illegitimate. Ali’s followers believed that the Prophet Muhammad himself had named Ali as successor and that the status quo was a violation of divine order.The first four caliphs are known among Sunni Muslims as the Rashidun or Rightly-Guided Ones.. They are Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman ibn Affan, and Ali. Of these four, only Ali is accepted by the Shia. Sunnis believe that caliphs should be chosen by election or community consensus. Early in 2014, Zawahri expelled Baghdadi from al-Qaeda. Baghdadi claims to be caliph, and he aspires to command all of Islam through what is now called the Islamic State. But he is not alone in making such a claim. Mullah Omar, who is leader of the Afghan Taliban, asserts he is the true commander of the faithful.
how long is the incubation period for the plague	The period of time between being infected with the Yersinia pestis bacteria and when symptoms first appear is called the plague incubation period. Plague Incubation Period: A Summary. When a person becomes infected with the bacteria that cause plague (Yersinia pestis), the bacteria begin to multiply within the body. With bubonic plague, this occurs in the lymph system; with pneumonic plague, this occurs within the lungs.Bubonic plague is the most common primary manifestation, with a bubo usually occurring in the groin, axilla or cervical nodes. Buboes are often so painful that patients are generally guarded and have restricted movement in the affected region. The incubation period for bubonic plague is usually 2 to 6 days. If bubonic plague is untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream and spread rapidly, causing septicemic plague, and if the lungs are seeded, secondary pneumonic plague. Septicemic and pneumonic plague may also be primary manifestations. Recommended antibiotic treatment for plague. Begin appropriate IV therapy as soon as plague is suspected. Gentamicin and fluoroquinolones are typically first-line treatments in the United States. Duration of treatment is 10 to 14 days, or until 2 days after fever subsides. Oral therapy may be substituted once the patient improve

what is tilapia fish made of	According to Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, over 95 percent of tilapia consumed in the U.S. in 2013 came from overseas, and 73 percent of those imports came from China. One reason is that the fish thrives in a subtropical climate, making it a difficult fish to farm in most of the U.S. The truth is, tilapia has as much omega-3 as other popular seafood, including lobster, mahi-mahi and yellowfin tuna. Tilapia is also very low in fat. A 4-ounce serving of tilapia has about 1 gram of saturated fat, 29 grams of protein and around 200 mg of omega-3. By comparison, a 1-ounce serving of bacon (about 4 strips) contains 4 grams of saturated fat, 10 grams of protein and 52 mg of omega-3A variety of tilapia, Oreochromis lidole is one of the most popular fish in Malawi. It is locally known as 'chambo' in Malawi. It is endemic to bodies of water in Malawi like Lake Malawi, Lake Malombe and the Shire River. Due to over fishing, the fish however is now on the threatened species list. In Indonesia, tilapia are known as ikan nila. Tilapia were introduced to Indonesia in 1969 from Taiwan. Later, several species also introduced from Thailand (Nila Chitralada),Philippines (Nila GIFT) and Japan (Nila JICA). Tilapia has become popular with local fish farmers because they are easy to farm and grow fast.

what lipid are present in the cell membranes of animal cells have inside	The cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment. The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells. The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings. It consists of the phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. The cell membrane also plays a role in anchoring the cytoskeleton to provide shape to the cell, and in attaching to the extracellular matrix and other cells to help group cells together to form tissues.Since outside the cell is a water-containing, or aqueous, environment, and inside the cell is also aqueous, the phosphate heads of the phospholipids face both the cell's inside and the environment outside the cell, while the fatty acids face the inside of the membrane. Molecule for molecule, cholesterol can make up nearly half of the cell membrane. 1 Since it is smaller and weighs less than other molecules in the cell membrane, it makes up a lesser proportion of the cell membrane's mass, usually roughly 20 percent. 2. Cholesterol is also present in membranes of organelles inside the cells, although it usually makes up a smaller proportion
how does international sim card work	How it Works. Insert The SIM Card. Turn your phone off, open the battery housing (located in the back of your phone), remove the existing SIM Card (if applicable), and insert your Global SIM Card. Store the existing SIM card in a safe place. Turn the phone back on. Make and receive calls or text messages while traveling abroad can be very expensive. To help curb this expense, United World Telecom has introduced an exciting mobile solution: the Global SIM Card. The Global SIM Card is a small chip that you insert into the back of any unlocked GSM phone. Each UWTMobile Global SIM Card comes with a unique European mobile number where your contacts can reach you (US or UK numbers are also available)Remember, that these sim cards do not work on all phones and phones must necessarily be unlocked in order to use the sim card. In order to unlock your phone, call your carrier and ask for an unlock code or simply go online and unlock it, paying a fee. You will then be free to use the phone as and how you please! However, targeting business travelers especially, who need to travel out on work more often, constantly need the mobile phone at their service. So it is best for a traveler on budget or otherwise to insert a new international sim card in their phone to use for the duration of their trip.

what is a more scientific name for chemical energy	For example, the chemical energy in a battery is converted into electrical energy. The electrical energy, which involves the motion of electrical charges or currents, can be used to power everyday devices like computers and flashlights. Mechanical energy can also be transformed into electrical energy. The energy stored in these chemical bonds can be released and transformed during any type of chemical reaction. Think of when you're hungry. When you eat a piece of bread to satisfy this hunger, your body breaks down the chemical bonds of the bread and uses it to supply energy to your body.Energy that can be released (or absorbed) because of a reaction between a set of chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants. This change in energy is change in a chemical reaction. Chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement may be the result of chemical bonds within a molecule or otherwise. Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction. As an example, when a fuel is burned the chemical energy is converted to heat, same is the case with digestion of food metabolized in a biological organism
the organelles in eukaryotic cells are surrounded by	The nucleus, the largest organelle in eukaryotic cells, is surrounded by two membranes, each one a phospholipid bilayer containing many different types of proteins. The inner nuclear membrane defines the nucleus itself. The various techniques described earlier have led to an appreciation of the highly organized internal structure of eukaryotic cells, marked by the presence of many different organelles (Figures 5-42 and 5-43). Here we present a brief overview of the major organelles.Organelles have a wide range of responsibilities that include everything from generating energy for a cell to controlling the cell's growth and reproduction. Eukaryotic cells are cells with a nucleus. The nucleus is an organelle that is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope separates the contents of the nucleus from the rest of the cell. Eukaryotic cells also have a cell membrane (plasma membrane), cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and various cellular organelles. 1 Nucleus-a membrane bound structure that contains the cell's hereditary (DNA) information and controls the cell's growth and reproduction. 2  It is commonly the most prominent organelle in the cell. 3  Mitochondria-as the cell's power producers, mitochondria convert energy into forms that are usable by the cell.
what is the internal temperature of medium rare roast beef	Traditional guidelines for doneness state that beef cooked very rare, rare, or medium-rare should have an internal temperature ranging between 115ºF to 140°F. Many people prefer beef cooked rare (especially steak), but this decision is up to the consumer and is certainly not recommended by the USDA. Because of the increased concern with harmful bacteria that may be present in beef, medium-rare (145ºF on a meat thermometer, using updated guidelines) is the minimum degree of doneness that is recommended. Internal Temperatureof Beef Cooked Medium-Rare (after resting period). Traditional Guidelines:A beef roast cooked to medium-rare should have an internal temperature of 145°F - 150ºF after the resting period, and a roast cooked to medium should have an internal temperature of 150°F to 160ºF. (See the note below). See Beef Doneness for more information on proper cooking temperatures. Place the beef on a rack in a shallow roasting pan with the fat side up. Do not cover the roast and do not add any liquid (liquid is used for braising, not roasting). Allow the beef to roast at 450°F for 45 minutes and then begin checking the internal temperature of the meat with a meat thermometer. Continue roasting the meat until the internal temperature has reached 5 or 10 degrees below the desired donenes
selling car logbook in different name	Filling in the log book when selling to a private individual. The first step is that you will need to fill in your car's log book also known as a V5C certificate. Turn to section 6 of the log book entitled new keeper or new name/new address details and fill in the details of the buyer. Then turn to section 8 of the same log book and, along with your buyer, sign the declaration contained in this section. Filling out your log book when selling to a trader. When selling to a motor trader, rather than to an individual, you complete and hand over a different section called the V5C/3. In these cases you must also get the contact details and signature of the trader and post them to the DVLA at the same address as above.If you sell your car privately it is vitally important that you make sure the change in ownership is properly documented with the state. Otherwise, it could haunt you. I often represent people who have bought defective cars and I have been discussing automobile sales with people now for 23 years. While many people focus on the car they are buying, the car they are selling needs some attention as well. Especially if you are selling it to an individual. In most instances, a person can sell something to someone else by agreement. You and I agree that my widget will cost you $100.
can optic nerves regenerate	The nervous system is divided into the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Fortunately, damaged peripheral nerves can regenerate after injury. However, the optic nerve and the spinal cord are in the central nervous system, and unfortunately cannot regenerate after injury. This is thought to be a result of inhibitory factors that are produced by cells that normally support the nerve fibers. In goldfish, the optic nerve can regenerate after injury. Molecular factors involved in structural support, gene regulation, and nerve fiber growth are produced in the goldfish optic nerve after injury. In fish, these factors are produced over a long period of time, allowing repair and regrowthFor example, in animals such as fish and frogs, an injured optic nerve regenerates fully, allowing for a complete restoration of vision. In mammals, it has been shown that retinal ganglion cells, when put under conditions found in the peripheral nervous system, can successfully regenerate their axons. It is there that the electrical impulses are interpreted into sight. Damage to the optic nerve interrupts this flow of visual information. In glaucoma, researchers believe that the ganglion cells of the retina, as well as the support cells within the optic nerve, can die for various reasons.
what is a pilot rollout	It is therefore advisable that you try to design the pilot deployment program so that the new software is installed on a wide variety of different hardware and that any software that could potentially conflict with the new software is in use on at least some of the machines in the pilot deployment program. Conclusion. As you can see, a pilot deployment program should be an essential part of any new software deployment. In this article, I have given you hints based on my real world experience in an effort to try to help you to make deploying Windows Vista and Microsoft Office 2007 as painless as possible.1. Define Success. First, define what success of the pilot program looks like. This gives you a benchmark to compare against later, and helps you judge at the program’s completion if the technology is indeed ready for organization-wide rollout. For many organizations, success is defined as time saved. Posted by Jason Haddad on Tue, Feb 04, 2014 @ 08:32 AM. A newly introduced technology will not succeed if user adoption is low. Pilot programs offer organizations the ability to rollout new technology in small numbers before attempting large-scale implementation. In doing so, you can: 1  Define best practices when using the new solution. 2  Identify kinks, challenges and onboarding issues
Sustained contraction is called	II. Muscles in vitro can exhibit twitch, summation, and tetanus. A. The rapid contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers is called a twitch. B. A whole muscle also produces a twitch in response to a single electrical pulse in vitro. 1. The stronger the electric shock, the stronger the muscle twitch, whole muscles can produce graded contractions. 2. B. The motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates are called a motor unit. 1. When a muscle is composed of many motor units (such as in the hand), there is fine control of muscle contraction. 2. The large muscles of the leg have relatively few motor units, which are correspondingly large in size.The complete contraction of a muscle, without the ability to relax, is called _____. a sustained contraction. fatigue. tetanic contraction. treppe. 36. The constant contraction of a percentage of fibers within a muscle is referred to as _____. tetany. tonus. sustained contraction. summation. 37. Contractions called _____ occur whenever the forces applied to a muscle are increased, but the muscle does not appear to be moving. The period of time between the stimulus and contraction is called the _____. latent period. refractory period. contraction period. relaxation period. 34. The period of time in which a muscle will not respond to a stimulus
how long and what temperature do you cook turkey meatballs	Confidence votes 156. Bake at 350 degrees until cooked through, between 15 and 35 minutes, depending on the size of the meatball and your particular oven. The surest method is to use a meat thermometer, with the internal temperature being at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Basically it's a pound of ground meat (any kind, even ground turkey), an egg, a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and 1/2 … cup of bread crumbs. You can fry them, bake them, or simmer them. When you mix the ground meat, seasonings, egg, and bread crumbs, form your meatballs. Brown them in a skillet turning on all sides until the are browned on all sides and break one open to make sure they are cooked through. If you bake them, put them on a cooking sheet and bake at 350 for about 20 minutesReady In. 1  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 2  In a medium bowl, mix together the ground turkey, egg, and bread crumbs using your hands. 3  Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then turn them over, and continue baking for about 5 more minutes, or until somewhat crispy on the outside. 1 In a medium bowl, mix together the ground turkey, egg, and bread crumbs using your hands. 2  Using an ice cream scoop if possible, form the meat into golf ball sized meatballs. 3  Place about 1 inch apart in the hot baking dish.
is phosphorus diatomic	White phosphorus consists of 4 atoms of phosphorus, with each of the atoms sitting at the corner of a tetrahedron. In the more stable red phosphorus, the P4 tetrahedrons are linked together, resulting in a more stable, less reactive allotrope of phosphorus. Key: diatomic element polyatomic element.A number of elements are found in their elemental form as diatomic molecules. In these molecules, two atoms are joined by one or more covalent bonds, forming a molecule with the general formula X 2.o. Lr. Key: diatomic element polyatomic element A number of elements are found in their elemental form as diatomic molecules. In these molecules, two atoms are joined by one or more covalent bonds, forming a molecule with the general formula X2.Phosphorus can form a diatomic molecule P 2 with a triple bond, like N 2, but only at higher temperatures and in the gas phase. It easily forms a tetrahedral P 4 molecule that exists in the gas phase and also as a waxy solid and viscous liquid, melting at 44.1°C and boiling at 280°C. On burning, it produces P 2 O 5 smoke, as white phosphorus does. White phosphorus usually has a yellow tinge due to small amounts of red phosphorus, so it is sometimes called yellow phosphorus. The red and yellow forms are good examples of allotropes, like diamond and graphite.
what does nlgi grease mean	The NLGI consistency number (sometimes called “NLGI grade”) expresses a measure of the relative hardness of a grease used for lubrication, as specified by the standard classification of lubricating grease established by the National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI). The test grease is inserted into the container and the plunger is stroked 60 times while the test apparatus and grease are maintained at a temperature of 25 °C. Once worked, the grease is placed in a penetration test apparatus. This apparatus consists of a container, a specially-configured cone and a dial indicator.The NLGI consistency number is also a component of the code specified in standard ISO 6743-9 “lubricants, industrial oils and related products (class L) — classification — part 9: family X (greases)” . The NLGI consistency number alone is not sufficient for specifying the grease required by a particular application. However, it complements other classifications (such as ASTM D4950 and ISO 6743-9). The test grease is inserted into the container and the plunger is stroked 60 times while the test apparatus and grease are maintained at a temperature of 25 °C. Once worked, the grease is placed in a penetration test apparatus. This apparatus consists of a container, a specially-configured cone and a dial indicator.
where do wild turkeys nest	Additional information can be found at DEC's Language Assistance Page. Home » Animals, Plants, Aquatic Life » Birds » Bird Species » Wild Turkey » Wild Turkey Nesting Habitat. For optimal reproduction turkeys require good nesting habitat. Wild turkey hens begin to nest before most of the new growth begins in the spring; therefore, at least for initial nests, hens need some residual cover from the previous year to conceal their nest from predators. Wild Turkey Nesting Habitat. The following are some suggestions for managing some specific habitat types for nesting habitat. Remember that these are suggestions only, there are no hard and fast rules and you can decide what methods you wish to employ on your land.Wild turkeys are active during the day and roost in trees overnight. They nest on the ground and the young turkeys (poults) are able to leave the nest shortly after hatching. They immediately begin foraging for insects, but stay in a brood with the hen until their flight feathers have developed. Aggressive Turkeys. Remember that wild turkeys have a pecking order and that habituated birds may respond to you as they do to another turkey. The best defense against aggressive or persistent turkeys is to prevent the birds from becoming habituated in the first place by being bold to them.
retino- means eye or eyeball	Retinoblastoma is a cancer that starts in the retina, the very back part of the eye. It is the most common type of eye cancer in children. Rarely, children can have other kinds of eye cancer, such as medulloepithelioma, which is described briefly below, or melanoma. They usually cause eye pain and loss of vision. The diagnosis is made when a doctor finds a tumor mass in the eye by using an ophthalmoscope (an instrument that helps doctors to look inside the eye). Like retinoblastoma, the diagnosis is usually made based on where the tumor is inside the eye and how it looks.This form of cancer develops in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. In most children with retinoblastoma, the disease affects only one eye. However, one out of three children with retinoblastoma develops cancer in both eyes. The most common first sign of retinoblastoma is a visible whiteness in the pupil called cat's eye reflex or leukocoria. In the non-germinal form of retinoblastoma, typically only one eye is affected and there is no family history of the disease. Affected individuals are born with two normal copies of the RB1 gene. Then, usually in early childhood, both copies of the RB1 gene in retinal cells acquire mutations or are lost.
what does a smart car cost	Australia: The Smart Fortwo has been marketed through select Mercedes-Benz dealers in Australia since 2003 in only the middle 'Pulse' range, and with the petrol engine. As of April 16, 2007 the base price for the Fortwo coupe coupé Is$ 19,900, 19900 and for The fortwo cabriolet is22,900. 22900 The Smart Fortwo is a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive, 2-seater, 2-door hatchback city car manufactured and marketed by the Smart division of Daimler AG, introduced in 1998, now in its third generation.I recently spent a week driving the 2013 Smart coupe. I loved driving it. I had a ton of fun zipping around Manhattan and Brooklyn. But I wouldn't buy one. Why I Loved It. I've been intrigued by Smart since my approximately 12-year-old mind was blown on a trip to Paris by the first one I ever saw. Watch the 2013 Smart coupe in action below: Why I Wouldn't Buy One. To be clear, I'm not saying I don't want a Smart: If I found one outside my apartment with a bow on it, I would be thrilled. But two very important things bothered me: The price and the fuel economy. The Smart coupe starts at $12,490, but the model I drove cost $19,490. In comparison, a 2013 Nissan Sentra — a perfectly fine car with room for five people — starts at $15,590. The Smart I drove was comfortable, but hardly loaded with features
where are persian people from	Ethnic Persians can also be found outside Iran and include the Tajiks and Farsiwan of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Xinjiang province of China. Like the Persians of Iran, the Tajiks are descendents of various Iranian peoples, including Persians from Iran, as well as numerous invaders. Tajiks and their cousins the Farsiwan have a particular affinity with Persians in neighboring Khorasan due to historical interaction some stemming from the Islamic period. Persians are typically characterized by their usuage of the Persian language and a common culture and history. Persian identity, at least in terms of language, is traced to the ancient Indo-European Aryans who arrived circa 2000-1500 BCE.For the usage of Persian people as a pan-ethnic group designating the people of modern Iran (Persia), see Iran. The Persian people (Persian: پارسیان) are an Iranian people who speak the modern Persian language and closely related Iranian dialects and languages. The term Persian translates to from Persis  which is a region north of the Persian Gulf located in Pars, Iran. The influence of the Persian people, and Persian culture in the post-Islamic world can hardly be exaggerated. From influences in India and Asia, to those in Arabia, Rome, Greece, Persian presence has left a lasting impression.
how do you resurface corian countertops	Step 3 – Use Abrasive Pads. Scratches can be removed by using the green side of abrasive pads. Use a light sanding motion, following the direction of the scratch first, and then against the direction of the scratch. Apply more pressure later as needed. Dust off residue and clean the abrasive pad in between sanding. Step 6 – Refinish your Countertop. Using the sponge, create a matte finish by rubbing the entire surface. If you want a gloss finish, use a white polishing paste together with your sander fitted with finishing pads.Wash the entire Corian counter top with just water and a clean towel. Load the sander with the next finest grit sandpaper (1000) and sand the entire area with that, still spraying with water while you sand. Use a large rubbing action to blend the sanding lines. Then use the next lightest (800) and do the same thing. Clean the Corian counter top with water again and then rub the entire area with the yellow side of the green and yellow scrubbier pad. This will give you a matte finish on your Corian countertop. If you want a gloss finish, continue to step 8. Instructions. Clean off the Corian counter top and wipe it down, just to get all of the crumbs and dirt off of the counter. Use the green side of the green and yellow scrubbier pad on the small, minor scratches.
which black individual was killed in the boston massacre	The Boston Massacre, known as the Incident on King Street by the British, was an riot on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed several people while under attack by a mob. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed coloThe Boston Massacre Do you know who is considered to be the first hero of the American Revolution? The Boston Massacre was a struggle that took place in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 5, 1770, just before the start of the American Revolution. Late that day, a crowd of colonists gathered to shout at and bother some British troops. Boston residents were resentful of the presence of the troops in their city. As tension mounted, the soldiers suddenly fired their muskets. Five colonists were shot and killed. Crispus Attucks, a black sailor and former slave, was shot and became the first person to die in the American Revolution. The violent incident became a rallying point for American patriots, led by Samuel Adams. Crispus Attucks's body was laid out at Faneuil (pronounced fan-yule) Hall in Boston.
where does colles fracture occur	A distal radius fracture almost always occurs about 1 inch from the end of the bone. The break can occur in many different ways, however. One of the most common distal radius fractures is a Colles fracture, in which the broken fragment of the radius tilts upward. This fracture was first described in 1814 by an Irish surgeon and anatomist, Abraham Colles -- hence the name Colles fracture. A Colles fracture occurs when the broken end of the radius tilts upward. Other ways the distal radius can break include: 1  Intra-articular fracture. 2  A fracture that extends into the wrist joint. ( 3 Articular means joint.). 4  Extra-articular fracture. 5  A fracture that does not extend into the joint is called an extra-articular fracture. 6  Open fracturThe end toward the wrist is called the distal end. A fracture of the distal radius occurs when the area of the radius near the wrist breaks. Distal radius fractures are very common. In fact, the radius is the most commonly broken bone in the arm. The break can occur in many different ways, however. One of the most common distal radius fractures is a Colles fracture, in which the broken fragment of the radius tilts upward. This fracture was first described in 1814 by an Irish surgeon and anatomist, Abraham Colles -- hence the name Colles fracture.
cost of paying someone to lay laminate flooring	If there are no repairs required to your subfloor, the contractors will likely charge you between $10 and $60 per hour for cleaning. Cost of Padding. Before the laminate flooring is installed there has to be ample padding. The color of your woodwork and the type of wood required will determine how much you pay. Expect to add between $1 and $6 per sq ft to your cost of installing a laminate floor depending on the kind of woodwork you will need. Cost of Labor. The cost of labor for installing laminate flooring will depend on your location and the contractor you pick for the job. A professional contractor will charge you anywhere between $1 and $5 per square foot of floor or charge you hourly rates from $10 to $60 per hour1 With some additional costs for underlayment and matching baseboards/trim, it can run $450-$950 for basic laminate materials for a 20x20-square-foot living room. 2  Laminate prices are based in large part on how realistic-looking the flooring is; inexpensive laminate may look artificial. 1 (It can be more for a custom-designed installation with an elaborate pattern, and small projects may have a minimum charge of $200-$500 .) For a 400-square-foot living room, labor and materials can run $1,250-$3,000 with basic laminate and $2,100-$5,000 with better quality products.
what is a sangrita	(June 2012). Sangrita (meaning little blood), whose origin dates back to the 1920s, is a customary partner to a shot of straight tequila blanco; a non-alcoholic accompaniment that highlights tequila's crisp acidity and cleanses the palate between each peppery sip. In essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the fruit salad from which it was strained. In almost all cases the drink took its bright red color from a mix of the fine pepper powder, spices, and pomegranate, while the base was mainly orange or sweetened lime juice.The key to a balanced sangrita recipe can be found in the fruit salad's recipes, which would have included any or all of the following: tangerine, cucumber, papaya, mango and jicama. Traditionally, sangrita is served with tequila blanco, but it can also accompany tequila reposado. The tequila and sangrita are each poured into a separate shot glass (or caballito) and the two are alternately sipped, not chased. In essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the fruit salad from which it was strained. In almost all cases the drink took its bright red color from a mix of the fine pepper powder, spices, and pomegranate, while the base was mainly orange or sweetened lime juice.

what landform changes are happening in landslides	Label the center oval: “Processes that Change the Earth’s Surface.” (Teacher models this.)c. Remind students to create a new oval for each new main idea and rectangles for each new supporting detail.d. Ask students to think about what they have already learned in the Land & Water unit (STC) or Landforms unit (FOSS). Volcanoes also can occur as a result of plate movement. A volcano is a vent in the surface of the Earth through which magma (molten rock called “lava” when it reaches the surface) and associated gases, erupt. Volcano is also the term used to describe the structure produced by material ejected through the vent.A landslide, also known as a landslip, is a geological phenomenon that includes a wide range of ground movements. Rockfalls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows were common. Landslides can occur in offshore, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Shallow landslides can often happen in areas that have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils. The low permeable, bottom soils trap the water in the shallower, high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils.
average time women spend working out a day	Men spend an average of 15 minutes per day on this, while women do roughly half that. [ ALSO: 5 Takeaways From the Latest Census Data ]. Women also spend nearly twice as much time caring for other household members, like children, than men do. ...At the Office, That Is. While men spend more time at work, women by far perform more duties around the house. On an average day, women do three times as much housework as men do and more than twice the amount of food preparation and cleaning. Men do lead women in one area of home improvement: lawn and garden care.Below, a rundown of some of the fascinating differences of how Americans of different genders spend their time. Men Work More Than Women Do. Men work longer hours than women do, and by a long shot: on days that they work, men work just over eight hours per day on average, nearly a full hour longer than women did. However, these figures are not that surprising, given that women are less likely than men to work full-time. ...At the Office, That Is.

what does the communicating artery in the brain do	In human anatomy, the anterior communicating artery is a blood vessel of the brain that connects the left and right anterior cerebral arteries. The anterior communicating artery connects the two anterior cerebral arteries across the commencement of the longitudinal fissure. Sometimes this vessel is wanting, the two arteries joining together to form a single trunk, which afterward divides; or it may be wholly, or partially, divided into two. The arteries of the base of the brain. Anterior communicating artery at top. The temporal pole of the cerebrum and a portion of the cerebellar hemisphere have been removed on the right side. Inferior aspect (viewed from below).At the base of the brain, the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries form a circle of communicating arteries known as the Circle of Willis. From this circle, other arteries—the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the posterior cerebral artery (PCA)—arise and travel to all parts of the brain. Normal function of the brain’s control centers is dependent upon adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients through a dense network of blood vessels. Blood is supplied to the brain, face, and scalp via two major sets of vessels: the right and left common carotid arteries and the right and left vertebral arteries.

On average, the cost for one year of high school cheer for a new member is between $700 and $1000. For a returning member, the average is between $500 and $800.1 Aside from the start up fees, plan on spending at least $75 to $200 per month to cheer in a competitive setting. 2  The yearly costs for competitive cheerleading, on average, can range from $2,000 to as much as $4,300; this would include everything necessary to participate with the club. 1 Overall, the costs are going to greatly depend on how much the team is going to travel for the year and the level of competition in which they participate. 2  According to one mom on Yahoo! 3  Answers, she paid a $100 monthly fee, an $850 competition fee per year and $500 for the uniform.
what is sockeye salmon	Most wild-caught sockeye salmon sold in the U.S. is from Alaska, with those from the Copper River being particularly prized and Bristol Bay being particularly prolific. Commericial catches of sockeye also come from Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. While king or chinook salmon may get all the attention and many people swear by its superiority, sockeye salmon is a richly textured and highly flavorful salmon. For people who like the flavor of salmon, sockeye is the way to go, since it tastes the most, well, like salmon. Sockeye eat more plankton and crustaceans like shrimp than other salmon species, which contributes to their darker color. While chinook are fattier, sockeye are the second fattiest salmon, and they have the added benefit of having the firmest texture of all Pacific salmonSockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) — also called red salmon or blueback salmon in the United States — is an anadromous species of salmon found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and rivers discharging into it. This species is a Pacific salmon that is primarily red in hue during spawning. They can grow up to 84 cm in length and weigh 2.3 to 7 kg. Juveniles remain in freshwater until they are ready to migrate to the ocean, over distances of up to 1,600 km. Their diet consists primarily of zooplankton.

what shades of color did picasso use to paintings	Pablo Picasso's Blue Period - 1901 to 1904. The Blue Period of Picasso is the period between 1900 and 1904, when he painted essentially monochromatic paintings in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colors. Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in The Blindman's Meal (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of Celestina (1903). Other frequent subjects include female nudes and mothers with children. A significant influence on Picasso's blue period paintings was his visit to a woman's prison called St. Lazare in Paris, where nuns served as guards. The Two sisters is an example of how Picasso used to mix daily reality with Christian iconographyPicasso and the Mood of a Painting. The mood of a painting can be strongly influenced by its colors. Interestingly, there are several cases where a painting’s colors are quite abnormal, but the luminance is correct. Our Where system sees the paintings clearly, but our What system is confused by the coloring. Self-Portrait, Pablo Picasso, 1901. Here, Picasso presents himself as a romantic, bohemian figure — a moody young artist who fixes the viewer with a hypnotic stare. In Picasso’s “Blue Period” (1901-1904), his blue paintings portray destitute human being
what causes blackish brown diarrhea	Black stool is a condition in which the feces are very dark or black in color. Black stool may be normal in some cases and caused by ingesting certain substances or medications, such as iron supplements. However, black stool can also be caused by a serious condition, such as bleeding in the digestive tract caused by a peptic ulcer. Black stool that is tarry in texture and foul smelling is often a symptom of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from the esophagus, stomach or small intestine. This is called melena. Rectal bleeding of bright red blood with clots, sometimes mixed with stool, is called hematochezia.Black stools caused by blood indicate a problem in the upper digestive tract. Blood in the stool can be detected through a stool test. Black stool along with pain, vomiting, or diarrhea is cause to see a doctor right away. If blood in the stool is suspected, a doctor should contacted as soon as possible. Black Stools Caused by Food or Supplements. A black stool could be caused by food, supplements, medication, or minerals. Iron supplements, taken alone or as part of a multivitamin for iron-deficiency anemia, may cause black stools or even green stools. Foods that are dark blue, black or green may also cause black stools. Substances that are often found to cause black stools include:
what organs and tissue are affected by addison's disease	Addison’s disease affects your body’s adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are part of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is a group of glands all over your body that produce hormones to regulate your body’s processes, including your moods, growth, metabolism, and tissue function. The adrenal glands are located just above your kidneys. They produce hormones that affect how your body responds to stress. In people who have Addison’s disease, the adrenal glands do not produce enough corticosteroid hormones, such as cortisol and aldosterone. Addison’s disease is most common among people 30 to 50 years of age, but it can occur at any age and affects men and women equallyAddison’s disease is caused by an autoimmune response, which occurs when the body’s immune system (which protects it from infection) assaults its own organs and tissues. With Addison’s disease, the immune system attacks the outer portion of the adrenal glands (the cortex), where cortisol and aldosterone are made. Other causes of Addison’s disease include: 1  injury to the adrenal glands. 2  infection, including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS-related infections, and fungal infections. 3  cancer cells from another part of the body that have invaded the adrenal glands. 4  bleeding into the adrenal glands. 5  surgical removal of
tsa passenger fee	Now, passengers must pay a flat fee of $5.60 in each direction, no matter how many plane transfers are made to get from one city to another. For passengers flying a nonstop round trip, that means the fee will increase from $5 to $11.20. Passengers flying round-trip with a connection each way will see their fees increase $1.20 to $11.20 per round trip, versus $10 before the fee increase. Most of the new revenue will go to pay down the federal deficit. Until Monday, a passenger was charged $2.50 for each leg of a journey. For a nonstop round trip, the cost was $5. For a round trip with a connection each way, the cost was $10. The fee was capped at two flights each way.As noted above, the TSA aviation-passenger security fee has not increased since it was instituted in 2001. The House-passed budget resolution proposed to change the aviation-passenger-security-fee structure, beginning in 2015, to a simple one-way-trip maximum of $5.00—regardless of the number of enplanements. It would also eliminate the ASIF fee charged to air carriers. The higher passenger fee collections would allow TSA to ultimately offset about 43 percent of aviation-security costs. [1] Air carriers are charged an Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee (ASIF), which accounts for about 20 percent of total fees collected.
what are the characteristics ester	Esters are derived from carboxylic acids. A carboxylic acid contains the-COOH group, and in an ester the hydrogen in this group is replaced by a hydrocarbon group of some kind. This could be an alkyl group like methyl or ethyl, or one containing a benzene ring like phenyl. A common ester-ethyl ethanoate. The most commonly discussed ester is ethyl ethanoate. The acid CH3(CH2)16COOH is called octadecanoic acid, but the old name is still commonly used. This is stearic acid. The full name for the ester of this with propane-1,2,3-triol is propane-1,2,3-triyl trioctadecanoate.In chemistry, esters are chemical compounds derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one-OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an-O- alkyl (alkoxy) group. Usually, esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Glycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol, are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids, and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. As a class, esters serve as protecting groups for carboxylic acids. Protecting a carboxylic acid is useful in peptide synthesis, to prevent self-reactions of the bifunctional amino acids. Methyl and ethyl esters are commonly available for many amino acids; the t-butyl ester tends to be more expensive.
what color is bile	H&E stain. Bile or gall is a dark green to yellowish brown fluid, produced by the liver of most vertebrates, that aids the digestion of lipids in the small intestine. In humans, bile is produced continuously by the liver (liver bile), and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder (gallbladder bile). The color of bile is often likened to fresh-cut grass, unlike components in the stomach that look greenish yellow or dark yellow. Bile may be forced into the stomach secondary to a weakened valve (pylorus), the presence of certain drugs including alcohol, or powerful muscular contractions and duodenal spasms.Stool comes in a range of colors. All shades of brown and even green are considered normal. Only rarely does stool color indicate a potentially serious intestinal condition. Stool color is generally influenced by what you eat as well as by the amount of bile — a yellow-green fluid that digests fats — in your stool. As bile pigments travel through your gastrointestinal tract, they are chemically altered by enzymes — changing the pigments from green to brown. Light-colored, white or clay-colored. A lack of bile in stool. This may indicate a bile duct obstruction. Certain medications, such as large doses of bismuth subsalicylate (Kaopectate, Pepto-Bismol) and other anti-diarrheal drugs.

what is excitation contraction coupling	Excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) is the process whereby an action potential triggers a myocyte to contract. When a myocyte is depolarized by an action potential, calcium ions enter the cell during phase 2 of the action potential through L-type calcium channels located on the sarcolemma. When calcium binds to the TN-C, this induces a conformational change in the regulatory complex such that troponin-I (TN-I) exposes a site on the actin molecule that is able to bind to the myosin ATPase located on the myosin head.excitation-contraction coupling. the link between excitation of muscle membrane and initiation of force generation at cross-bridges, producing muscle contraction. In all types of muscle this involves a rise in cytoplasmic calcium concentration [Ca 2+ ] but mechanisms for this rise differ substantially. excitation-conduction-contraction. in the stimulation of muscle contraction this is the coupling which occurs at the sarcolemma-sarcoplasmic reticulum junction. Mediated by the release of calcium ions in the aqueous sarcoplasm. excitation-contraction coupling. conversion of an excitation stimulus into contraction of the effector muscle fiber; ionic calcium is the link between the two. indirect excitation. electrostimulation of a muscle by placing the electrode on its nerve
average cost per cubic foot concrete	1 An average cost for a cubic yard of concrete is $75 to $125, depending on how much is needed and local prices. 2  Labor costs to pour and form concrete run somewhere around $3.50 to $7.00 per square foot. 3  One homeowner paid $11,000 for a crawl space for a 1,500 square foot home. 1 Labor costs to pour and form concrete run somewhere around $3.50 to $7.00 per square foot. 2  One homeowner paid $11,000 for a crawl space for a 1,500 square foot home. 3  One customer in Texas received a quote for a 2,500 square foot foundation slab of about $20,000.We pour a lot of 3000 psi. concrete for interior concrete floors and 4000 psi concrete for exterior concrete. The concrete cost per yard of concrete is $92.00 for 3000 3/4 psi concrete and $100.00 for 4000 3/4 psi concrete. So 10 yards of concrete is approximately $1000.00 dollars U.S. here in Maine. Because the cost of a cubic yard of concrete has topped $100.00 dollars per yard in a lot of areas around the U.S., it's helpful to know the exact cost in your area.

The cost for a yard of concrete will vary in different parts of the country and all over the world
what causes decreased MCHC	A lab test called the complete blood count, or CBC, measures the amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell -- the MCH. The MCHC measures the amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell in relation to the size of the cell. If your hemoglobin is low, your body cells do not receive adequate oxygen. A complete blood count includes an MCH and MCHC. Photo Credit Keith Brofsky/Photodisc/Getty Images. Nutritional deficiencies can cause anemia; if you are anemic, your lab tests show a low MCH, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and low MCHC, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. MCH and MCHC are used to diagnose anemia and can help determine what kind of anemia you haveWhen the average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell is decreased, then the concentration is decreased. So, when the MCV is decreased, the MCHC is decreased. Increases in the MCHC are limited by the amount of hemoglobin that can fit inside a red blood cell. Severe burns or a disorder called hereditary spherocytosis can cause high MCHC values. When MCV values are normal, the red blood cells are normal in size. They are called normocytic. However, a person with normocytic red blood cells can still be anemic when there are too few red blood cells or when other RBC indices are abnormal. This is called normocytic anemia.
hip pain and soreness	Pain in the hip can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities of the skin, nerves, bones, joints, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the hip can all result in pain. Sometimes diseases that affect other joints in the body, such as the inflammation resulting from arthritis, can be the cause of pain in the hip. Hip pain may also occur because of a problem with the back or spine. Depending upon the cause of hip pain, the pain may occur when walking, running, or engaging in activity. Bursitis of one of the two bursae of the hip (sacs that provide cushioning between bones and tissues) can cause hip pain.Hip pain is a common complaint that can be caused by a wide variety of problems. The precise location of your hip pain can provide valuable clues about the underlying cause. Problems within the hip joint itself tend to result in pain on the inside of your hip or your groin. Hip pain on the outside of your hip, upper thigh or outer buttock is usually caused by problems with muscles, ligaments, tendons and other soft tissues that surround your hip joint. Hip pain can sometimes be caused by diseases and conditions in other areas of your body, such as your lower back or your knees. This type of pain is called referred pain. Most hip pain can be controlled with self-care at home. 1  Causes
how much interest on student loans	Interest rates on Federal Stafford Loans are currently the same for the subsidized and unsubsidized versions. The interest rate on a federal consolidation loan is based on the interest rates of the federal education loans that are consolidated. Interest rates on private student loans may be based on the credit history of the borrower (and cosigner, if any) and can be either fixed or variable. Student Loan Interest Deduction. Up to $2,500 total in interest on federal and private student loans may be deducted on the borrower’s federal income tax return each year. The deduction occurs as an above-the-line exclusion from income and so may be claimed even if the borrower doesn’t itemize deductions.For the 2011 school year, new Stafford loans came with interest rates of 6.8 percent. This type of loan is the most common type of federal student loan. If your Stafford loan is subsidized rather than unsubsidized, it does not begin accruing interest until after you leave school. Interest Rates for Private Student Loans. Interest rates for private student loans commonly fall between 9 and 11 percent. Because these interest rates are not regulated, they can be much higher in some cases. Prospective students should keep a closer eye on interest rates if they are considering private student loans.

what causes a mucocele	Mucocele Causes. It is usually caused due to obstruction or rupture of a salivary gland duct in the mouth, which results in the swelling of a part of the gland. This condition is also known as the ranula. Here are some common causes that are associated with the formation of a mucocele, . 1  Mouth injury may result in the damage to the duct, which in turn may result a mucocele. 2  Habitual biting of the lip and other mouth areas may also increase the risk of injury to the duct. Mucocele may often go unnoticed, however some individuals may report certain symptoms, that may arise due to discomfort. However in most cases, the condition is completely painless. 1  A small bump most often under the tongue is observed. 2  A bump may also be observed on other areas, along the floor of the mouth.Mucocele, or mucous retention cyst, is the cyst that forms on the interior of the lip. Although they can be virtually harmless, mucoceles can potentially scar the lip permanently. However, some mucocele causes tend to worsen if not given proper medical attention. Mucocele results when individuals habitually suck the inner lip because of the pressure placed on the membranes that result to the collection of clear liquid, forming the cyst. The condition is also common among those who have pierced tongue.

similarities between dna and rna	1 DNA and RNA base pairing is slightly different, since DNA uses the bases adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine; RNA uses adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine. 2  Uracil differs from thymine in that it lacks a methyl group on its ring. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, while RNA is ribonucleic acid. Although DNA and RNA both carry genetic information, there are quite a few differences between them. This is a comparison of the differences between DNA versus RNA, including a quick summary and a detailed table of the differences.A single DNA nucleotide is made up of a base, a phosphate and a deoxyrib … ose sugar. In RNA, the sugar is a RIBOSE sugar, not a deoxyribose. 3. A DNA nucleotide can have 4 different bases (Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine or Adenine) but an RNA nucleotide will have Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine and URACIL instead of Thymine. 4. DNA is only found within the nucleus of the cell. RNA can be found in the cytoplasm of the cell as well as in the nucleus. Viruses, which are generally not considered to be living, contain one or the other. Here are some major … differences between RNA and DNA: With the exception of a few viruses, RNA is a single-stranded molecule while DNA is double-stranded. The two DNA chains are connected by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases.
images of how phones have changed over time	The phone was used solely as just that: a phone. The Motorola cell phone could be used only for voice calls and it connected via an analog network. Since then, phones have taken on a number of additional functions and they make use of digital networks for the transfer of wireless data packets. When asking how have cell phones changed, the single biggest change is the shift toward multifunctionality. Professional Technology Writer. Few technologies have advanced quite as quickly as what the world has witnessed in relation to how have cell phones changed in the last ten to twenty years. The mobile phone is still a very modern and recent invention, but it has evolved very rapidly with new features, new functions, and new innovationsThe First Mobile Phone. In 1946, Swedish police used the first mobile phone. The device was similar to a two-way radio but worked via a connection to the telephone network and the car's battery. The phone was able to make just six phone calls before draining the car battery. Its battery allowed for one hour of talk time and could store 30 numbers. These first-generation phones came in a tote back that could charge the battery via your car's cigarette light adapter. Others looked vaguely like briefcases that packed along larger batteries for longer talk time.
what part of brain is involved in taste	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The primary gustatory cortex is a brain structure responsible for the perception of taste. It consists of two substructures: the anterior insula on the insular lobe and the frontal operculum on the inferior frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe. Because of its composition the primary gustatory cortex is sometimes referred to in literature as the AI/FO(Anterior Insula/Frontal Operculum). By using extracellular unit recording techniques, scientists have elucidated that neurons in the AI/FO respond to sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, and sourness, and they code the intensity of the taste stimulus.This section will review the studies that implicate the amygdala in taste learning processes [ 12 ]. First, a brief description of the phenomenon of CTA will be provided. Then we will analyse the research that points to the amygdala and its nuclei as part of the brain mechanisms of CTA. The amygdala is a limbic structure involved in various processes of associative learning. Specifically, research has shown that the amygdala is part of the brain mechanism of taste aversion learning [11, 24, 41, 67, and 75]. Its role in aversive taste memory, however, is not entirely clear. Apparently, the taste memory trace requires the activity of the insular cortex [ 148 ]
how long do savannah monitors get	Neonate Care. Once you have neonate savannah monitors, set them up in groups of two or three in terraria about 18 inches long, 12 inches wide and 13 inches tall. A standard 15-gallon tank will be fine. However, an ideal height is 3 feet, so the young monitors can climb. At the very least you need a large terrarium measuring at least 6 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall with at least 3 feet of soil substrate. A mature pair of savannah monitors should be at least 1.5 years old or more. Sexing monitors can be tricky, even for experts.Enclosures for adult savannah monitors can get quite expensive so you may want to look into making your own. Hatchlings only need a 20-gallon aquarium with a mesh lid until they are 10-12 inches long. Adults will need a floor space of 8 x3 as a minimum, and the more room for them to move around in, the better. They are on the smaller side of the monitor family, and are great pets to own if you are looking for something larger than a bearded dragon. Appearance. A savannah monitor has the potential to reach over three feet in length. It can take two or three years for a savannah monitor to reach its full size. These monitors are a dusty brown or grey, and do not have a lot of coloration. When properly cared for, savannah monitors can live for 10-15 years
thiamine dose for goats	Another recommendation that uses vitamin B1 instead of Thiamine. The dosage for B1 (thiamine) is 500 mg per 100 weight every six hours, so check any B vit. to make sure you give your goat enough of the B1, and as you say overdosing will not hurt them, they urinate out what they don't need. Usually have to give this amount, every six hours, for a week at least. Causes. 1  Things that can cause the rumen to not produce the required thiamine are: 2  Rumen acidosis cause by excessive concentrate feeding and sudden feed changes. 3  Moldy feeds. 4  Thiabendazole-active ingredient in some wormer medication like Thibenzole Sheep & Goat Wormer. 5  Levamisole-wormer. 6  Some types of ferns. 7  Following a shot of an antibiotic. 8  OverdoProducers should always keep thiamine on hand; the most commonly available strength is 100 mg/ml. Dosage is based on the goat's weight (4-1/2 cc per 100 pounds liveweight for 100 mg/ml thiamine) and must be given every six hours on a 24-hour cycle until all symptoms have disappeared completely to avoid relapse. With Goat Polio and Listeriosis, a goat is usually totally off feed and water. This means that the producer must stomach tube nutrients (electrolytes, energy, protein) into the goat. A 100 pound goat needs one gallon of fluids daily. That is 3,840 cc's.
how deep does a planter need to be for vegetables	Free Shipping. How deep (or tall) a raised bed should be depends on the rooting depth requirements of the plants you wish to grow, and whether the ground below the planter is made of healthy soil. Shallow rooted plants such as lettuces, greens, annual herbs and most flowers can be grown in planters 11 to 16.5 inches tall, though even these plants may grow larger if given more soil. Taller planters also provide easier access and reduce the need for bending over.For most plants, a 6-to 8-inch-deep planter box is sufficient. The depth may vary for some vegetables, however. Turnips, cucumbers, broccoli, beets, lettuce and green onions can all grow well in a planter box at that depth, but other vegetables, like cabbage, need a deeper depth of at least 10 inches. Vegetables like tomatoes, carrots and peppers require a deeper container of at least 12 inches. To make sure any vegetable root balls have adequate growing space, leave 2 inches of space on the roots' sides and 6 inches on the bottom. Large bulbs require a planting depth of 8 inches, which means the planter box should allow for the 6 inches needed at the bottom, as discussed earlier, making the depth at least 14 inches. Most smaller bulbs are planted at 3 to 4 inches deep, so they would do fine in planter box with an 8-inch depth
doppler effect in light and measurement of speed	The Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves such as light is of great use in astronomy and results in either a so-called redshift or blueshift. It has been used to measure the speed at which stars and galaxies are approaching or receding from us; that is, their radial velocities. The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters.The Doppler Effect for light is the change in the observed frequency or wavelength/color compared with that emitted from a moving source. Note: Typically, the observed frequency is measured in the Doppler Effect. However in same cases, the change in wavelength is measured. The source of light or electromagnetic radiation must travel at a high speed for the Doppler effect to cause an observable shift in the frequency and wavelength. Since the speed of light is much greater than the speed of the source, an approximate equation can be used to determine the shift of the radiation. The shift in wavelength is used in astronomy to tell when a distant galaxy or star is moving toward the Earth (blue-shift) or away (red-shift).
what is a continuity tester	It is used with the current turned off to determine whether a particular electrical component is carrying electricity and to pinpoint the cause of a problem. To use a continuity tester, unplug the appliance and disassemble it to get at the component you want to test. Fasten the clip of the tester to one wire or connection of the component, and touch the probe to the other wire or connection. If the tester doesn't light or buzz or it reacts only slightly, the component is faulty. Caution: Do not use a continuity tester unless the appliance is unplugged or the power to the circuit is turned off.A continuity tester is an item of electrical test equipment used to determine if an electrical path can be established between two points; that is if an electrical circuit can be made. The circuit under test is completely de-energized prior to connecting the apparatus. The tester consists of an indicator in series with a source of electrical power-normally a battery, terminating in two test leads. If a complete circuit is established between the test-leads, the indicator is activated. The indicator may be an electric light or a buzzer. This led to the term buzzing out a circuit (which means to test for continuity) . Audible continuity buzzers or beepers are built into some models of multimeter
what is a snubber network?	Snubber Networks. The function of the snubber network is to limit the rate of change of the voltage across the motor (out-put terminals of the L6203) when one of the DMOS devices is turned off. The snubber capacitor is calculated from the peak current and the target rise time. The capacitance is given by the equation: When the snubber network is installed in the application the voltage transients on the terminals of the L6203 are greatly reduced, as shown in figure 2. The drawback of a snubber network of this type is that a current spike will flow into the transistor when it is switched on as the capacitor is discharged. The theoretical peak value of this spike is given by the equation : The following graphs are of operating voltages with snubber network and bypass capacitorSnubber Networks Snubber Networks are easily selectable electronic components designed to prevent or substantially minimize the occurrence of arcing and noise generation in relay and switch contacts. Snubber Networks consist of specially designed capacitors and resistors connected in series. The dielectric material in capacitors, used in Snubber Networks, affords a very high degree of voltage withstand strength. All resistors are non-inductive types to ensure a high degree of protection against pulse potentials.

cost to replace gyprock	1 $15 to $20m2 for plasterboard -- supply and install. 2  $4 to $16 per linear metre for cornice installation (mid-range). 3  $5 to $10 per linear metre for supply and installation of cornices (mid-range). 4  I choose you 3. Cornices and other decorative plaster products can cost much more, but these estimates show the average difference between the cost of Gyprock® and similar products and their installed costs. The average size of a Gyprock® installation is about 170 square metres. With a $5 difference in supply and installation rates for plasterboard, that can amount to a difference in quotes of nearly $900. Clearly, it's worth getting quotes from plasterers if you want to get the best priceCost to gyprock whole house. My parents live in Innisfail and their house was badly damaged by cyclone larry in march 2006. They finally got a new roof and windows put in last week only 1 year and 5 months later. Anyway their existing walls are masonite which have bowed due to water damage. All these rates are for min 2 day jobs. I now get my sparky and plumber through a local well regarded builder but the rates are still around $70 - $80. Said builder is currently building a few townhouses (smaller wall area than my house) and he said each townhouse cost him 18k for gyprock and finish wipes.
specific types of sedimentary rocks	Such material, called detritus, consists of fragments of rocks and minerals. When the energy of the transporting current is not strong enough to carry these particles, the particles drop out in the process of sedimentation. This type of sedimentary deposition is referred to as clastic sedimentation. LIthification of sediment into sedimentary rocks takes place after the sediment has been deposited and buried. The processes by which the sediment becomes lithified into a hard sedimentary rock is called diagenesis and includes all physical, chemical and biological processes that act on the sediment.Sedimentary rocks are formed by the accumulation of sediments. There are three basic types of sedimentary rocks. Clastic sedimentary rocks such as breccia, conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, and shale are formed from mechanical weathering debris. Chemical sedimentary rocks, such as rock salt, iron ore, chert, flint, some dolomites, and some limestones, form when dissolved materials precipitate from solution. Organic sedimentary rocks such as coal, some dolomites, and some limestones, form from the accumulation of plant or animal debris. Photos and brief descriptions of some common sedimentary rock types are shown on this page. Coal is an organic sedimentary rock that forms mainly from plant
what vegetables are natural diuretics	Most of the time it’s hydrating fruits and vegetables that are diuretics, and oats seem to be a food that soaks things up, the way it soaks cholesterol up. But oats can also give you relief if you’re retaining water. 18. Garlic. Garlic provides a cleansing effect, and also acts as a diuretic, which is all the more reason to use it in more of your cooking. It has yet to be shown that garlic pills are a diuretic as well, and it appears that eating garlic in it’s natural form, or in powder form, is the way to go if this is your goal.Leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, dandelion greens and even cilantro and parsley, are natural diuretics. Leafy greens, particularly dandelion and parsley, work by boosting your liver and kidney functions, increasing the amount of urine your body produces. Photo Credit Eising/Photodisc/Getty Images. Regular urination is important for keeping your system free of toxins and other wastes, helping you maintain healthy blood pressure levels and reducing the risk of health complications. Certain vegetables are natural diuretics, which are substances that encourage urination. To ensure there are no potential complications, speak with a medical professional before you decide to drastically change your diet, as natural diuretics may cause problems with medication
vallenato is from what region	Climate in the municipality of Valledupar is determined by altitude. Half of the region is mountainous and the rest is plains in between the mountain ranges of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serrania del Perija. perijá To the south, the route 80 highway connects with the rest of Colombia including northern regions of Colombia, like Santa Marta, Barranquilla and Cartagena; to the west two road access to some other villages to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.Daniel’s Intro to Vallenato. The most popular music in Colombia, more than salsa or reggaeton, is a strange accordion-driven music known as vallenato, which comes from the Caribbean coast of the country, specifically the town of Valledupar. Vallenato is the only genre that is equally beloved in every region of Colombia. It is the music that Gabriel Garcia Marquez danced to when he celebrated winning his Nobel Prize for Literature, and he even described his most famous novel, 100 Years of Solitude, as a 400-page vallenato. Basic vallenato consists of three instruments: 1  The caja, a small drum played with bare hands like a bongo (which arrived along with the slaves from Africa). 2  The guacharaca, a small, ribbed stick that is scratched with a fork, making a sound similar to maracas. 3  The accordion, of German origin.
cost of an architect to amend plans	To give you an idea of costs I will tell you what my firm charges. If the project is done on an hourly basis it is $125/hr for me the architect and $85/hr for my CAD technicians. We usually charge a lump sum fee for a project based on my budgeting how much time I believe the project will take based on the rates above. Typically for single family new construction, minimum 5% to 6% of construction cost should cover the cost of an architect's time. However 6% to 8% will be needed to cover architect's overheads and profits (Engineers extra add another 2%.).If you want to amend your house plans, the best time to do this is during the drafting process. It’s much easier to make amendments while your professional is using CAD than to try and make changes further into the project. The cost of your house plans depends on the size and scope of the project. Larger properties will take longer for the drafter, architect or building designer to plan and document, so will cost more. Design fees may be charged by the house, at a fixed price or as a percentage of the total construction costs. Generally, it can cost anywhere between $5000 and $10,000 for a custom home design to be created and submitted to council. Your costs will increase if you choose an architect over a drafter or building designer
what was the incas official religion	RELIGION Pachacuti drastically reorganized the Inca religion. He claimed to be the direct descendant of the Inca Sun God Inti, which made his people extremely obedient. Their daily work tasks almost became a religious duty. Pachacuti created a cult around himself and the sun-god Inti.he Inca emperor Pachacuti first of all appointed himself as a holy emperor. He claimed he was the direct descendant of the creator god Pachacamac (also called Viracocha). Under his rule, Cuzco became a 'huaca', or holy place, dedicated to the sun god Inti.The native elements are more obvious in the case of the sunrise divination. Apachetas, coca and the sun were major elements in pre-Conquest religion, and divination, the worship of sacred mountains and the bringing retribution against enemies were important ritual practices. In the heterogeneous Inca Empire, polytheistic religions were practiced by its people. Most religions had common traits such as the existence of a Pachamama and Viracocha.any ancient Andean peoples traced their origins to ancestral deities. Multiple clans could share similar ancestral origins. The Inca claimed descent from the Sun and the Moon, their Father and Mother. Many clans claimed descent from early proto-humans that they emerged from local sites in nature called pacarinas.
how long can you keep tea	First of all, you'll need to store the tea bag in a moist medium. Once they get dried out, they become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. So your best bet is to store them in a small shot glass filled with water. That will keep them seeping while they are being stored. While you can leave them out in your kitchen, I usually put them in the fridge so that there is less chance of bacteria growth. If you think you've got bacteria or mold in your tea bag, the best indicator is smell. If it smells funky, trash it. A tea bag can be reused one or two times. After that, it's spent. Reusing green or white tea works better than darker blends. I usually reuse Orange Pekoe tea bags because I use two bags in one cup: I like strong milk tea in the mornings, with milk, no sugar.Best Answer: Tea bags don't go 'bad' in the way that fresh foods can get bacteria and actually make you sick when they go bad. Tea bags just lose their freshness and quality with time and exposure to light. Generally tea in bags will be at their best within 6 months after you purchased them. To keep them as fresh for as long as possible, keep them in an airtight container out of direct light. I highly recommend that if you really love tea that you try loose leaf tea - the flavour and quality is so much better. Enjoy!

nba refs salary	NBA Referees Salaries in 2015. NBA referees are responsible for the official games that has been played all 30 teams in season. NBA referees have a fulltime job with each team playing 82 games during a regular season. The referee must be perfect and physically fit and can run along with players to check the foul’s, game-play and match rules. The young referee’s who were participating in the NBA league almost get the $1,500 per game for their services, they have this low salary because of lack of experience, with past of time their salaries were increased as they become the experienced member of the NBA Officials. WNBA Referees: Annual Earnings ($180,000) :The average salary of an NBA referee is from $150,000 to $550,000. The average salaries have spiked considerably since 1983, when NBA officials made between $18,146 and $78,259 each season. The National Basketball Association (NBA) referees are responsible for officiating games played by each of the 30 teams in the league. Senior nba referees: The case of senior referees is somewhat better as they earn as much as $550,000 every year. The NBRA contested this too though, as they argued that these referees earn only $400,000 per year. WNBA referees: The referees in WNBA make considerably less ($500 per game or about $16,000 per year)

what does the lotus flower symbolize in hinduism	The ultimate lotus flower meaning in the Hindu belief system is that the lotus flower symbol represents awakening to the spiritual reality of life. The opening of a lotus flower represents rising from primal thought and base energies to highest spiritual consciousness. The lotus flower in Hinduism has many layers of symbolism. The lotus appears in creation stories, enlightenment stories, and in association with the chakras. Like the Egyptian lotus flower symbolism mentioned on the last page, Hindus have a creation story with a lotus as well.The Lotus Flower, Hindu God's Favorite Flower. Both in worship and in portrayals of the divine, Hindus are infatuated with lotus flowers. The very name of the Hindu worship ritual, puja, can be translated as flower act.. The lotus is the foremost symbol of beauty, prosperity and fertility. According to Hinduism, within each human is the spirit of the sacred lotus. It represents eternity, purity, divinity, and is widely used as a symbol of life, fertility, ever-renewing youth. For Buddhists, the lotus flower symbolizes the most exalted state of human; head held high, pure and undefiled in the sun, feet rooted in the world of experience. There is a story that the lotus arose from the navel of God Vishnu, and at the center of the flower sat Brahma.
what is Cistercian architecture is characteristic of	Cistercian architecture is considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval architecture. Additionally, in relation to fields such as agriculture, hydraulic engineering and metallurgy, the Cistercians became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the Rule of St Benedict. Rejecting the developments the Benedictines had undergone, the monks tried to replicate monastic life exactly as it had been in Saint Benedict's time; indeed in various points they went beyond it in austerity.The architecture of light of Acey Abbey represents the pure style of Cistercian architecture, intended for the utilitarian purposes of liturgical celebration. Cistercian architecture is a style of architecture associated with the churches, monasteries and abbeys of the Roman Catholic Cistercian Order. It was headed by Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153), who believed that churches should avoid superfluous ornamentation so as not to distract from the religious life. This new Cistercian architecture embodied the ideals of the order, and was in theory at least utilitarian and without superfluous ornament. The same rational, integrated scheme was used across Europe to meet the largely homogeneous needs of the order.
what are the effects of a straightened cervical lordosis	Scoliosis can affect the normal lordotic curvature in the neck. Cervical spondylolisthesis is a major source of reversed lordotic curvature. Severe disc pathologies can facilitate a gradual loss or reversal of cervical lordosis. Vertebral irregularities, such as wedging, can definitely contribute to lordotic alteration. Reversal of Cervical Lordosis Causes. The spinal curvature in the neck is constantly in flux to some degree. Congenital conditions and developmental conditions can have lasting effects on the natural degree of curvature typically demonstrated from patient to patient.Loss of normal curve: Our cervical spine (neck) typically is curved with the head and shoulder portions slightly behind the mid neck portion. That is similar to your low back curvature. Both are termed lordosis. It is opposite to the curve of your back at the ribs, called kyphosis. Loss of lordosis in the neck is usually from spasm, or side view x-rays with your head on too-high a pillow. Get help from a doctor now ›. Lordosis: Normally the neck area, or cervical spine, has a curve where the middle part bends out toward the front of the body. The xray here shows a loss of some of that normal curve. Losing this curve can be caused by many things including poor posture, neck muscle strain or osteoporosis.
what were the effects of pearl harbor on the u.s.'s economy	Pearl Harbour had a positive impact on the United States because it galvanized the nation, prompted America into entering World War Two, and led to the end of the war. Rob Cotey Firstly, Pearl Harbour positively affected the United States because it galvanized the nation. As a result of Pearl Harbour, the entire nation was unanimous in regards to entering the war. 16 million American men and women joined the military to fight on America’s behalf.2 As author John Denson said, “It took the dramatic event of the attack Rob Cotey on Pearl Harbor to shift public opinion overwhelmingly to support our entry into theThe Effects of The Bombing of Pearl Harbor. Many events have happened in the past century to change society and the way the world lives. Some of these things have been for the better and some have been more tragic. December 7, 1941 marked a day in history never to be forgotten, this was the day that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The attack on Pearl Harbor affected many people in a way that would change their lives forever. The attack on Pearl Harbor caused many people to lose their lives, it caused American to enter World War II and it also caused the economy to change. The attack on Pearl Harbor began as part of Japan's larger plan to conquer Southeast Asia (Arroyo 12).
how much calcium do you need a day	Your doctor may also suggest taking a magnesium supplement with a calcium supplement, because these minerals work together in the body. For most people, a 2-to-1 ratio of calcium to magnesium is appropriate. So, if you take 1,000 mg of calcium each day, you should also take 500 mg of magnesium.There are two main types of calcium supplements: calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. Both types of supplement will give your body enough calcium.f your body doesn’t have enough calcium and vitamin D to support important body functions, it takes calcium from your bones. Over time, this calcium loss can put you at risk for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis occurs when the inside of the bones become porous from a loss of calcium. This is called losing bone mass.If you are younger than 50 years of age, you need about 1,000 milligrams (mg) of calcium per day. If you are older than 50, you need 1,200 mg of calcium per day. It is best to get your calcium throughout the day rather than all at once.f your body doesn’t have enough calcium and vitamin D to support important body functions, it takes calcium from your bones. Over time, this calcium loss can put you at risk for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis occurs when the inside of the bones become porous from a loss of calcium. This is called losing bone mass.
what is at modem	A modem (mo dulator-dem odulator) is a device that modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data. common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.In order for devices on the network to connect to the Internet, the router must be connected to a modem. Therefore, most routers have a specific Ethernet port that is designed to connect to the Ethernet port of a cable or DSL modem. A modem is a device that provides access to the Internet (see below).The modem connects to your ISP, which typically provides either cable or DSL Internet service.

what was the major result of the industrial revolution	Background. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the early 19th century before spreading to Belgium, France, Germany, the United States and Japan. It was a fundamental change in the way goods were produced, and altered the way people lived.A result of the Industrial Revolution was a movement of people and goods all around the world as global trade and migrations increased. Trade. A major result of the Industrial Revolution was an increase in global trade.Many industrial countries sought new markets for their goods, and raw materials from which to make those goods. A result of this increase in trade was imperialism of Africa, India, China, and much of the rest of Asia.he Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the early 19th century before spreading to Belgium, France, Germany, the United States and Japan.The Industrial Revolution began in the United Kingdom and most of the important technological innovations were British. Mechanized textile production spread to continental Europe in the early 19th century, with important centers in France.uring the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.
how to work out area	The perimeter, P, is: Example. Find the perimeter of this rectangle: The area is measurement of the surface of a shape. To find the area of a rectangle or a square you need to multiply the length and the width of a rectangle or a square. Area, A, is x times y. Example. Find the area of this square. There are different units for perimeter and area The perimeter has the same units as the length of the sides of rectangle or square whereas the area's unit is squared. Video lesson: Calculate the perimeter and the area in feet. 1  Pre-Algebra. 2  Algebra 1. 3  Algebra 2. 4  GeometryAssuming you know (or can measure) the dimensions of a triangle then you can quickly work out its area. The area of a triangle is (height × width) ÷ 2. In other words you can work out the area of a triangle in the same way as the area for a square or parallelogram just divide your answer by 2. The height of a triangle is measured as a right-angled line from the bottom line to the ‘apex’ (top point) of the triangle. Answers to above example. First, work out the area of the main shape of the house – that is the rectangle and triangle that make up the shape. The main rectangle (B × C) 7.6 × 8.8 = 66.88m 2. The height of the triangle is (A – B) 9.7 – 7.6 = 2.1. The area of the triangle is therefore (2.1 × C) ÷ 2.

Here are some guidelines: Real estate taxes: It is the general rule that the life tenant is responsible for paying all property taxes during his or her lifetime. Ordinary repairs, upkeep and maintenance: These are the responsibility of the life tenant; that person lives in the house and is obligated to preserve the propertyA life estate is an interest in real property with a duration measured by the life of a person or group of people. When that person or people die, the life estate is extinguished and the property automatically goes to the person or people who have a remainder interest in the property. Also, the court may order the holder of the life estate to make repairs, or to do or stop doing certain activities relating to the property ' s condition. The law also gives a lien to anyone who has a vested remainder interest in the property who paid for necessary repairs or improvements to
what is a measurement to measure the temperature of a substance	Heat and temperature are related, but not the same. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles of a substance. The higher the temperature of an object, the higher is its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is a type of energy associated with motion. Temperature is measured with thermometers, which are devices that use the expansion of a substance to give an indirect measure of temperature. When we measure an object's temperature, we measure the average kinetic energy of the particles in the object. The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules of the substance move, on the average. Dyes will spread more rapidly through hot water than cold water.1 Temperature: A convenient operational definition of temperature is that it is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy associated with the disordered microscopic motion of atoms and molecules. 2  The flow of heat is from a high temperature region toward a lower temperature region. 1 About Temperature Disponible en espanol. 2  Temperature, when measured in Kelvin degrees, is a number that is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. 3  So, when the molecules of a substance have a small average kinetic energy, then the temperature of the substance is low.
what are the cons of thorium reactors	CON: It's not immune. Thorium needs uranium or plutonium to fission, and when its bombarded with neutrons, it turns into uranium-233, a material that has been used to make bombs. PRO: The waste produced by thorium reactors is a small fraction of the waste produced by traditional nuclear power plants. Dangerous radioactive elements can be removed from the liquid with processing, condensing the dangerous materials into a tiny volume. Proponents of thorium molten salt reactors point to the MSRE as an important foundational piece of research. And it is, however it's important to note that though the reactor worked well, it never ran on thorium and never generated electricity.Before we get to the conclusion, here are some more pros of thorium reactors (continued from Part Two): There is 10 times more thorium available in the world than uranium. The world could actually run out of naturally occurring uranium in 80 years, but thorium is said to be so abundant it could last thousands of years. A thorium reactor could consume fissile materials from old uranium reactors and clean it up. Thorium reactors produce a tiny fraction of the radioactive waste that conventional uranium reactors produce, and their operation on a wide scale would reduce the sum of waste material in storage over time. 
how does temporal arteritis blindness occur	Although this condition usually occurs in the temporal arteries, temporal arteritis can occur in almost any medium to large artery in the body. Older individuals, over 60 years of age, are more likely than younger individuals to develop the condition. Potential Complications of Temporal Arteritis. Complications can occur as a result of both the condition itself and as a result of the oral corticosteroid treatment. If temporal arteritis is not treated, the following complications can occur: 1  inflammation and damage to other blood vessels in the body. 2  development of aneurysms, including aortic aneurysm. 3  vision loss. 4  eye muscle weakness. 5  blindness. 6  strokeTemporal arteritis is a condition in which the temporal arteries, which supply blood to the head and brain, become inflamed or damaged.

what inhibits osteoblast	An osteoclast (from the Greek words for bone (ὀστέον), and broken (κλαστός)) is a type of bone cell that breaks down bone tissue. This function is critical in the maintenance, repair, and remodelling of bones of the vertebral skeleton. The osteoclast disassembles and digests the composite of hydrated protein and mineral at a molecular level by secreting acid and a collagenase, a process known as bone resorption. This last hormone, IL-6, is one of the factors in the disease osteoporosis, which is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclast activity is also mediated by the interaction of two molecules produced by osteoblasts, namely osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand.Activation of hedgehog signaling inhibits osteoblast differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. Plaisant M, Fontaine C, Cousin W, Rochet N, Dani C, Peraldi P. Mesenchymal stem cells within the bone are responsible for the generation of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. In rodents, Indian hedgehog has been shown to play a role in osteoblast differentiation. However, evidence for a direct function of hedgehog (Hh) in human osteoblastic differentiation is missing. Using different models of human mesenchymal stem cells we show that Hh signaling decreases during osteoblast differentiation.
what does afqt percentile score mean	An AFQT percentile score indicates the percentage of examinees in a reference group who scored at or below that particular score. For current AFQT scores, the reference group is a sample of 18 to 23 year old youth who took the ASVAB as part of a national norming study conducted in 1997. Your scores from four of the tests Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), and Mathematics Knowledge (MK) are combined to compute your score on what is referred to as the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT).An AFQT percentile score indicates the percentage of examinees in a reference group that scored at or below that particular score. For current AFQT scores, the reference group is a sample of 18 to 23 year old youth who took the ASVAB as part of a national norming study conducted in 1997. Thus, an AFQT score of 90 indicates that the examinee scored as well as or better than 90% of the nationally-representative sample of 18 to 23 year old youth. Standard Scores are scores that have a fixed mean and standard deviation in the population of examinees. A Standard Score indicates how many units of the standard deviation a particular score is above or below the mean. In the case of the ASVAB subtests, the mean is set to 50 and the standard deviation is set to 10.

what is the meaning of expressionism	Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality. Expressionism was developed as an avant-garde style before the First World War. It remained popular during the Weimar Republic, particularly in Berlin. The style extended to a wide range of the arts, including expressionist architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film and music. Theodor Adorno describes expressionism as concerned with the unconscious, and states that the depiction of fear lies at the centre of expressionist music, with dissonance predominating, so that the harmonious, affirmative element of art is banished (Adorno 2009, 275–76).View More. Definition: Expressionism is a term used to describe a movement of the early 20th century (c.1905-20) that was most prominent in Germany and Austria. The aims of an Expressionist were to express emotions through the use of vivid colors and strong, distorted lines, rather than capturing a likeness or reality. Expressionism is the opposite of Impressionism, which emphasized painting what the artist observed. The work of Vincent van Gogh had a lot of influence on artists who are now classified as Expressionists.

psychoanalytic literary theory definition	The focus of analysis can be (1) the author of the work; (2) the work's contents; (3) the work's formal construction; or (4) the reader. Two key figures associated with psychoanalysis are Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. More recent advances in psychoanalytic theory has been made by feminist scholars. Juliet Mitchell in particular has written on psychoanalysis and feminism, and Julia Kristeva has extended the work of Lacan on psychoanalysis and language through a feminist perspective. However, because most psychoanalytic theory begins with Freud and Lacan, we'll concentrate just on those two theorists. In the 1950s and 1960s Lacan developed a structuralist theory of psychoanalysis based on the linguistic theory of Saussure. Lacan re-interpreted Freud, making explicit what was implicit in Freud's theories. He made it clear that Freud could not be taken literally, but symbolically.Psychoanalytic literary criticism is literary criticism or literary theory which, in method, concept, or form, is influenced by the tradition of psychoanalysis begun by Sigmund Freud. The danger is that 'such criticism tends to be reductive, explaining away the ambiguities of works of literature by reference to established psychoanalytic doctrine; and very little of this work retains much influence today'.
what is a cement deck/	Determine where you want to construct a concrete patio, how large it will be, and its exact dimensions. The size of the patio determines the amount of concrete required and whether you will need a mixer. If the patio is too large in area, it might not be an easy DIY job. The location is also important. 1 If mixing by hand, you can put the concrete mix into a mortar tub or a wheelbarrow. 2  Mix with a shovel or a hoe. 3  Make sure that when mixing concrete by hand you wear gloves and protective eye wear. 4  If using a mixer, make sure you can move the mixer into the area where you are building the patio.Concrete is in fact the most used material for construction in the world and has been in use since the age of the Roman Empire. Concrete is a mixture of aggregate (sand and gravel) combined with water and cement. Depending on the ratio of these parts the concrete can be stronger or weaker. Concrete hardens in a process known as hydration which is caused by the reaction between water and cement. Adding too much water can weaken the concrete. For most deck projects it is practical to buy bags of premixed concrete that are prepared by adding water and mixing. You can use a wheelbarrow and mix with a hoe to a consistency that is able to move and fill voids but is not too wet and soupy. 
how to treat barometric headaches	Coping. MayoClinic.com recommends that you keep a headache journal to cope with headaches that may be caused by changes in barometric pressure. List each incidence of a headache with information about when it occurs and how long it lasts. Indicate possible causes that include weather conditions. Sinus Headaches. Barometric pressure changes may lead to sinus headaches. Damp and cold weather may intensity pain in your sinuses and barometric pressure changes may trigger sinus headaches if your sinus cavities are slow to equalize air pressure inside your sinuses.Take a washcloth, damp it with cold water and pour a few drops of lavender oil and peppermint oil on it. Lie down and keep the washcloth on your forehead for 20-30 minutes to get the relief from this headache. Massage Therapy: Consult an experienced massage therapist to reduce barometric pressure headaches. He/she will give you a good massage on the painful spots of temple, scalp, neck and shoulders. This will promote blood circulation in these areas, which in turn has a relaxing effect on the pain. As a result, the blood vessels undergo expansion or contraction in an effort to adjust with the lowered level of oxygen. This change in the diameter of the blood vessels is often held responsible for a barometric pressure headache.

what causes a wart to grow	Even when warts are treated, the HPV virus may remain. This is why warts can come back after treatment. It isn’t clear if treating genital warts lowers a person's chance of giving HPV to a sex partner. It is not fully known why low-risk HPV causes genital warts in some cases and not in others. These types of HPV are called high-risk. Having high-risk HPV is not the same as having cervical cancer. But high-risk HPV can lead to cancer. Most often, high-risk HPV causes no health problems and goes away on its own. High-risk HPV cases that don’t go away are the biggest risk factor forA wart is a skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus (HPV) . HPV infects the top layer of skin, usually entering the body in an area of broken skin. The virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly, forming a wart. Most warts go away on their own within months or years. Warts can grow anywhere on the body, and there are different kinds. For example, common warts grow most often on the hands, but they can grow anywhere. Some people are more likely to get warts than others. Warts come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. A wart may be a bump with a rough surface, or it may be flat and smooth. Tiny blood vessels grow into the core of the wart to supply it with blood.

examples of eubacteria common and scientific names	They are gram-negative. The more common name for this type of eubacteria is blue-green algae, which thrives in nutrient-rich ponds and lakes. Some forms of cyanobacteria can modify into specialized cells known as heterocysts. Eubacteria are far more common than archaebacteria. The majority of types of prokaryotes (of which there are about 400) fit under this category. More eubacteria can be found in a person's mouth than there are people on the planet. They can serve numerous different purposes from decomposing to causing disease.1) An example of eubacteria is the blue green algae with the scientific name cyanobacteria. Blue green algae are unicellular prokaryotic cells which are very small. They do have a cell membrane, cell wall and DNA, but they don’t have a nucleus. It is classified in the eubacteria kingdom because it is a unicellular, prokaryotic organism. They are producers (photosynthetic bacteria). 2) Another example of eubacteria is Salmonella with its scientific name Salmonella typhi. The common name is fungi, and so is the scientific name. A fungus is any organism that gets its food by absorbing nutrients from and breaking down the bodies of dead/dying plants or animals. They suck up food from tiny threads called hyphae.

how long employment background check take	Patience when doing employment background checks can significantly reduce the risk of a bad hire! The idea of an instant background check sounds great. However, a quality background takes some effort and time. It takes time to identify, locate, and contact the correct court, employer, school, or licensing agency. For more information, see Proper Employment Background Checks: Patience Now Means Accuracy and Completeness Later. In addition, databases used in instant background checks are notoriously incomplete and out of date. The most common reason for delay is carelessness in filling out the Employee Background Check Request Form, the Applicant Authorization and Release Form, and the Job Application. Also, remember that information for a background check is gathered from multiple sources. Some courts, employers, and schools can be hard to contact or are slow to respond. Results from these sources are usually back within a weekAverage time. Most background checks can be completed between three days to one week. According to the University of Berkeley, FBI checks usually take around 30 days. Although some instant background checks are available, these rely on databases that can be incomplete or inaccurate. Instant criminal records databases, in particular, often contain many errors

Lunchmeats and hot dogs will last two weeks in the refrigerator unopened and should be eaten within 3-5 days of opening (hot dogs can go a couple of days longer). In the freezer they’ll last 1-2 months. Bacon is safe to eat for up to a week in the fridge—but raw sausage should be eaten within two days. Both can be frozen for a month, and some sausage will freeze for twice as long. Eggs can be refrigerated for up to a month raw but no more than a week hard-boiledRaw poultry lasts just a day or two in the fridge (at a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit or colder), but up to a year in the freezer. Cooked poultry can be refrigerated a few days longer and should be frozen no longer than 2-6 months. In the freezer they’ll last 1-2 months.

what are inside warts	Warts and Plantar Warts-Topic Overview. This topic has information about warts on any part of the body except the genitals. For information about warts on the genitals, see the topic Genital Warts. A wart is a skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus (HPV) . HPV infects the top layer of skin, usually entering the body in an area of broken skin. The virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly, forming a wart. Most warts go away on their own within months or years. Plantar warts grow on the soles of the feet. Warts are easily spread by direct contact with a human papillomavirus. You can infect yourself again by touching the wart and then touching another part of your body. You can infect another person by sharing towels, razors, or other personal items.It typically occurs on humans' hands or feet but often in other locations. Warts are caused by a viral infection, specifically by one of the many types of human papillomavirus (HPV). There are as many as 10 varieties of warts, the most common considered to be mostly harmless. 1 Genital wart (venereal wart, Condyloma acuminatum, Verruca acuminata), a wart that occurs on the genitalia. 2  Mosaic wart, a group of tightly clustered plantar-type warts, commonly on the hands or soles of the feet.
enzyme mediated reaction definition	Enzymes. Protein catalysts. (A few RNA molecules also possess catalytic activity). In an enzyme-mediated reaction, an enzyme binds to reactants (substrates) to form an enzyme-substrate complex, which breaks down to release products and the enzyme. The region of the enzyme to which the substrate binds is called the active site, the shape of which determines the chemical specificity of the enzyme. Cofactors. Substances that bind to enzymes to alter their conformations and make them active. Some cofactors are trace elements. Chemical reactions involve: (1) the breaking of chemical bonds in reactant molecules and (2) making of new chemical bonds to form product molecules. Energy is either added or released as heat during chemical reactions.Temperature: Increases in temperature will speed up the rate of nonenzyme mediated reactions, and so temperature increase speeds up enzyme mediated reactions, but only to a point. When heated too much, enzymes (since they are proteins dependent on their shape) become denatured. Many enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of reactions. By bringing the reactants closer together, chemical bonds may be weakened and reactions will proceed faster than without the catalyst. The use of enzymes can lower the activation energy of a reaction (Ea).
doxycycline single dose chlamydia	Doxycycline. Doxycycline is an antibiotic used to treat chlamydia infection. It is used mainly as an alternative to the antibiotic azithromycin. Doxycycline is equally as effective as azithromycin, but whereas azithromycin is a single dose treatment, doxycycline treatment needs to be taken twice daily for 7 days. 1  Avoid sexual contact whilst taking doxycycline and for 7 days afterwards, until no longer infectious. 2  People with a positive chlamydia test and their sexual partners should be ... Alternative antibiotic. The most frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of chlamydia is azithromycin taken as a single dose. Azithromycin is preferred by most doctors and patients because it is a single dose, although it is more expensive than doxycycline.OR. Ofloxacin 300 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. A meta-analysis of 12 randomized clinical trials of azithromycin versus doxycycline for the treatment of genital chlamydial infection demonstrated that the treatments were equally efficacious, with microbial cure rates of 97% and 98%, respectively (284). Treatment. Treating infected patients prevents sexual transmission of the disease, and treating all sex partners of those testing positive for chlamydia can prevent reinfection of the index patient and infection of other partners.
what is mildew	Mildew is a surface fungi that can easily be identified as a patch of gray or even white fungus that is lying on the surface of a moist area. Mildew is easily treated with a store bought cleaner and a scrubbing brush. Mold, on the other hand, can be black or green and is often the result of a much larger infestation. This type of fungus can appear almost fuzzy  especially when it is found on food  or even slimy in nature. While toxic mold is not common in homes that are regularly maintained, this form of mold can be dangerous to a person's health. Allergies, asthma, irritated eyes, headaches and even lung issues are the result of toxic mold that is breeding within a home.Mildew is a form of fungus. It is distinguished from its closely-related counterpart, mold, largely by its color: molds appear in shades of black, blue, red, and green, whereas mildew is white. Horticulturalists classify mildew differently than most other people. In horticulture, mildew is either species of fungus in the order Erysiphales, or fungus-like organisms in the family Peronosporaceae. It is also used more generally to mean mold growth. In Old English, mildew meant honeydew (a substance secreted by aphids on leaves, formerly thought to distill from the air like dew), and later came to mean mold or fungus
what is sulfite in wine	For wine making, sulfites, also known as sulphites, have been used for centuries. Sulfites within the range of six and 6,000 ppm can be found in everyday foods: canned tuna, pizza dough, jams, gelatin, trail mix, cheese, deli meat and even prescription pills. Wine is one of the few products that carries the words “contains sulfites” on its label. Headaches have not been shown to be a common allergic reaction to sulfites in wine. In fact, more sulfites are generally added to white wines than red wines and most headache sufferers complain after drinking red wines. Headaches are most likely due to other chemicals found in conventional wines. Little is known about sulfites and how people react specifically to them but more research is on the waySulfites or sulphites are compounds that contain the sulfite ion SO 3 2− . The sulfite ion is the conjugate base of bisulfite. Although its acid (sulfurous acid) is elusive, its salts are widely used. Sulfites are substances that naturally occur in some foods and the human body. In general, white wines contain more sulfites than red wines and sweeter wines contain more sulfites than drier ones. In the United States, wines bottled after mid-1987 must have a label stating that they contain sulfites if they contain more than 10 parts per million.
what foods contain phenylalanine	Foods that are derived from animals are typically rich in protein. Because phenylalanine is an amino acid, foods that are high in protein often contain significant amounts of phenylalanine. Nuts and Legumes. Nuts and legumes, such as peanuts, are also high in protein. Consequently, foods such as walnuts, peanuts, peanut butter, hazel nuts and Brazil nuts contain relatively high quantities of phenylalanine. The protein found in soy also contains phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be found in soybean flour, soy flour isolate and tofu. Other legumes -- including black beans, kidney beans and chickpeas -- are all high in protein and boost your phenylalanine intakFood Sources of Phenylalanine. Protein rich foods like beef, poultry, pork, fish, milk, yogurt, eggs, cheese, soy products, and certain nuts and seeds contain appreciable amounts of phenylalanine. Artificial sweetener aspartame also contains high amount of the amino acid. Top 10 Food Containing Phenylalanine. 1 Cottage Cheese: Dry cottage cheese contains 2300 mg of phenylalanine per cup, and the creamed product contains 1647mg/cup. 2  Roasted Peanuts: Roasted peanuts without skin contain 3500 mg of phenylalanine per cup. 3  Sesame Seeds: Sesame is a phenylalanine rich food (3000 mg/cup), and can be incorporated in many recipes.
what is distal colorectal adenoma	Neoplastic polyps of the bowel are often benign hence called adenomas. An adenoma is tumor glandular tissue, that has not (yet) gained the properties of a cancer. The common adenomas of the colon (colorectal adenoma) are the tubular, tubulovillous, villous, and sessile serrated (SSA). A colorectal polyp is a polyp (fleshy growth) occurring on the lining of the colon or rectum. Untreated colorectal polyps can develop into colorectal cancer. Colorectal polyps are often classified by their behaviour (i.e. benign vs. malignant) and/or etiology (e.g. as a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease). They may be benign (e.g. hyperplastic polyp), pre-malignant (e.g. tubular adenoma) or malignant (e.g. colorectal adenocarcinomaA significantly higher proportion of adenomatous polyps was found in the proximal colon (72.6 %) and right colon (76.1 %), compared with those found in the left colon (30.1 %) (P % of rectal polyps ≤5 mm were adenomas, and only 25 % of sigmoid polyps ≤5 mm were adenomas (Table 2). Polyp detection rates (PDRs) and adenoma detection rates (ADRs) by colon segment. The PDR and ADR correlated closely throughout the proximal colon but diverged in the distal colon, where the PDR was higher, primarily because of the removal of small (≤5 mm) polyps in the sigmoid and rectum.
what does screening test accomplish	It is important to remember the First Trimester Screen is a screening test and not a diagnostic test. This test only notes a mother is at risk of carrying a baby with a genetic disorder. Many women who experience an abnormal test discover later the test proved false. The First Trimester Screen is a routine screening that is not an invasive procedure and poses no known risks to the mother or baby. The First Trimester Screen results may warrant additional testing.Screening tests are laboratory tests that help to identify people with increased risk for a condition or disease before they have symptoms or even realize they may be at risk so that preventive measures can be taken. They are an important part of preventive health care. Screening tests help detect disease in its earliest and most treatable stages. Therefore, they are most valuable when they are used to screen for diseases that are both serious and treatable, so that there is a benefit to detecting the disease before symptoms begin. They should be sensitive-that is, able to correctly identify those individuals who have a given disease. Many routine tests performed at regular health exams are screening tests. Cholesterol testing and Pap smears for women are examples. Newborns are screened for a variety of conditions at birth
average percentage of expenses are salaries	A 403(b) plan is available only to tax-exempt employers. Although costs vary according to an employee’s occupation, findings of the most recent National Compensation Survey show that the average cost to private industry employers for retirement and savings benefits is 3.7 percent of total compensation. These costs are higher for union workers. Results of a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust show that the average employer costs for health insurance coverage for workers increased by 9 percent in 2011 compared to a 3 percent increase in 2010.Calculate your salaries as a percentage of operating expenses by dividing the total salary expenses by your total operating expenses. As an example, if you pay $145,000 in total operating expenses with a salary expense of $41,000, 28 percent of your operating expenses are salaries. A report by the Society for Human Resource Management indicates that retail industry businesses may have a salary to expense percentage of as little as 18 percent. As an example, if your company's gross revenue equals $320,000 and the total salaries for the same period are $38,600, your company spends 12 percent of all monies earned on salaries. Second Wind Consultants, Inc recommends a range between 15 to 30

what chemical in turkey makes you tired	Tryptophan is a component of the brain chemical serotonin, which gets converted into the well-known sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. Poultry and many other foods also contain tryptophan, in similar amounts to that found in turkey. Gram for gram, cheddar cheese actually contains more tryptophan than turkey does. The oft-repeated turkey myth stems from the fact that turkey contains the amino acid tryptophan, which forms the basis of brain chemicals that make people tired. But turkey isn't any more sleep-inducing than other foods.Turkey does have the makings of a natural sedative in i­t, an amino acid called tryptophan. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning that the body can't manufacture it. The body has to get tryptophan and other essential amino acids from food. Tryptophan helps the body produce the B-vitamin niacin, which, ­in turn, helps the body produce serotonin, a remarkable chemical that acts as a calming agent in the brain and plays a key role in sleep. The tryptophan in a Thanksgiving turkey has to vie with all the other amino acids that the body is trying to use. So only part of the tryptophan makes it to the brain to help produce serotonin. In the next section, we'll look at what may be the real reason why so many of us just want to take a nap on Thanksgiving.
what does the intestines do in the digestive system	Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma. In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood.Small Intestine. The small intestine is a long, highly convoluted tube in the digestive system that absorbs about 90% of the nutrients from the food we eat. It is given the name “small intestine” because it is only 1 inch in diameter, making it less than half the diameter of the large intestine. The small intestine is, however, about twice the length of the large intestine and usually measures about 10 feet in length. The small intestine winds throughout the abdominal cavity inferior to the stomach. Its many folds help it to pack all 10 feet of its length into such a small body cavity...

why does my temperature fluctuate	When basal body temperatures fluctuate a great deal, it is usually due to inconsistencies in temperature taking methods. Make sure you are taking your temperature at the same time every day, when you first wake up, after a solid block of sleep, and with a BBT thermometer. If you are doing all this and are still getting rocky temperatures, you can try taking your temperature vaginally. Some women notice more stable temperatures when taking their temperature vaginally. Temperatures can also fluctuate a great deal when you are not ovulating, or when you have cycles with delayed ovulationIt is actually quite normal for the body temperature to rise and fall somewhat over the course of the day and the night. For example, most people have a lower body temperature while they are sound asleep then they do during the day. However, it is generally not normal to feel uncomfortably and intermittently hot and cold during the day, especially if these sensation are interfering with your normal day to day functioning. For example, an alteration in the normal functioning of the thyroid gland, which regulates the body's metabolism, could produce episodes of feeling intermittently hot and cold. There are often other symptoms as well, such as change in weight or mood, and changes in the hair or skin.

how long do you let pasta boil	10. Cooking, Drying, or Freezing the Pasta: To cook the pasta immediately, bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt the water, and cook the pasta until al dente, 4-5 minutes. To dry, lay the pasta over a clothes drying rack, coat hangers, or the back of a chair, and let air dry until completely brittle. Mixing and kneading the dough takes about 10 minutes, then you let it rest for 30 minutes. You can use this resting time to pull together the ingredients for the pasta sauce. After resting, rolling out and cutting the dough takes maybe another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how fast you go and how many helpers you have.To cook pasta and prevent it from sticking, pasta needs Large pot.

what is a common predator for geckos	It is common for the Gecko to live in many regions where humans do as well. Most people tend to make accommodations for them and not really care that they are around. This is because the Lizard feeds on a variety of problematic insects including mosquitoes. Most people agree that they would rather have the Gecko around. The Gecko is a very small species of Lizard. Thanks to the infamous one on the make Geiko car insurance commercials where he is a spokesman. There are more than 1,500 different subspecies that belong to this categoryGeckos primarily eat insects and worms, but some of the larger species of gecko hunt small birds, reptiles and even small mammals such as mice. Some species of gecko are also known to eat a small amount of plant matter such as moss. Due to their small size, geckos have a number of natural predators around the world, with the snake being the main predator of the gecko. Other animals that prey on the gecko include large spiders, birds and some mammal species. Geckos are found in a wide variety of habitats in the warmer parts of the world including rocky deserts, mountains, jungles, rainforests, grasslands and even in urban areas where it is common to find geckos in houses. Geckos can range in size from just a few centimetre to more than 50 cm in length.

what muscle type a person cannot control voluntarily	Muscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis. There are three types of muscle, skeletal or striated, cardiac, and smooth. Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary. Cardiac and smooth muscles contract without conscious thought and are termed involuntary, whereas the skeletal muscles contract upon command. Skeletal muscles in turn can be divided into fast and slow twitch fibers.Muscle is a bundle of tissue that is capable of contracting. The primary functions of muscles are to generate force and cause motions. Your body has more than 600 different types of muscles. Muscles also contribute to 40 to 50 percent of your weight. Some muscles can be controlled consciously, while others are controlled automatically by your ... Skeletal Muscle. When people talk about muscles, they are usually referring to skeletal muscle. This type of muscle is attached to your bones through tendons, and it is the most abundant tissue in your body. The contraction of skeletal muscle causes the diverse movements of your skeleton. Skeletal muscle is a type of muscle that you can control voluntarily. The pectoralis major, biceps brachii, deltoid, rectus abdominis, and gastrocnemius are examples of skeletal muscle
what has more calories quinoa or brown rice	And, 1/3 cup of cooked long-grain brown rice has 71 calories, 0.58 grams of fat, 1.2 grams of fibre, and 1.66 grams of protein. Nutritional Data from FatSecret. Basmati rice is a long-grain rice that we traditionally use in Indian cooking and meals. All this means is that you have to eat them with a grain like rice to get all 9 amino acids. Key to note is that they don't have to be eaten together in the same meal, but within the same day.). Typically, 1/3 cup of cooked quinoa has about 75 calories, 1.17 grams of fat, 1.2 grams of fiber and 2.64According to the USDA, 1 cup of cooked brown rice has about 215 calories, 5 grams of protein, 1.75 grams of fat, 45 grams of carbohydrates, 3.5 grams of fiber and 1 gram of natural sugar. A cup of cooked quinoa has 220 calories, 8 grams of protein, 3.5 grams of fat, 39.5 grams of carbohydrates and 5 grams of fiber. Although quinoa is slightly higher in fat, it edges out brown rice in both amounts of protein and dietary fiber per serving. Taste. Cooked brown rice is just a bit darker than white rice, and it has a nuttier, chewier texture and more of a “bite.” The bran and germ have not been removed from the rice, so it can take longer to eat and digest. Quinoa is also somewhat chewy, but it has a softer texture and more of a neutral flavor.
how much does it cost to get my dogs teeth cleaned	It also varies by the size of the dog with cleaning for larger dogs costing more. According to my research, the low estimate for a simple teeth cleaning on a young dog would be $200 to $300. The same cleaning on a senior dog would cost an average of $125 more. If deep cleaning and extractions are needed, the cost could rise closer to $400 to $700 per dog. For two small dogs, one young and one senior, I should expect to pay approximately $800 to $1,000 when I get their teeth cleaned. Although they can’t give me a specific cost without a pre-dental exam, the estimate was $300 – $400 for a basic teeth cleaning, including the discharge antibiotics, per dog. If teeth needed to be extracted, the price could increase by $100 – $300. I checked out prices at a few more places to compare.I only paid $166 for my dog to get his teeth cleaned. They charge $98 for the procedure with no additional cost to pull any teeth. The additional cost were for blood testing, antibiotics and IV. 1 Some foods and treats can help to control plaque and tartar, which could help save hundreds, or even thousands of dollars, if they are part of an overall plan that prevents periodontal disease. 2  Dental diets cost about $30 for a 30-pound bag, or about $250 per year to feed a moderately active medium-sized dog.
granite counter top cost	The cost of a granite countertop will, of course, depend on the size of your surface area.

why is it good to learn a trade	“You get to meet a lot of different people and go to a lot of different places, you’re not stuck in the same place all the time,” Kieran says. “You’re always out and about meeting new people.”. Learning a trade can also make you very popular – especially in a crisis.“It means you can help friends out and give people advice and all that,” Martin says. “Plumbers are good friends or relatives to have.” Kieran adds that it’s definitely a bonus to be able to fix things at home if they go wrong.It’s a better job now than it was 30 years ago – it’s more lucrative but also more complex.”. Kieran Stanton is an electrician who didn’t know what he wanted to do when he left school ten years ago at 16. He decided to train as an electrician after his dad told him that learning a trade would help him in future life.Learning the skilled trade is one thing, but setting yourself up as your own business is another. Going to your region’s small business center can help with learning the details of how to set up a small business and what all is involved in running it.ecoming an electrician is a little bit more intensive than working with HVACR, but the pay is higher to make up for it. The BLS reports that as of 2012, the median wage was nearly $50,000 per year, which works out to about $24 per hour.
what does pancreatitis do	1 It is an important part of the digestive system, producing enzymes and hormones that help break down foods. 2  The pancreas is a 6 to 10 inch organ and is located behind the stomach. 3  It is fish shaped and extends horizontally across the abdomen. The pancreas has an endocrine function because it releases juices directly into the bloodstream, and it has an exocrine function because it releases juices into ducts. Enzymes, or digestive juices, produced by the pancreas are secreted into the small intestine to further break down food after it has left the stomach. The gland also produces the hormone insulin and secretes it into the bloodstream in order to regulate the body's glucose or sugar levelPancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas. 1  The pancreas is an abdominal gland situated behind the stomach in the upper abdomen. 2  The main function of the pancreas is to secrete hormones and enzymes that help with digestion and regulate blood sugar (glucose) metabolism. Pancreatitis is a condition that may be mild and self-limiting, though it can also lead to severe complications that can be life-threatening. The acute form of pancreatitis, in its most severe form, can have deleterious effects on many other body organs, including the lungs and kidneys.

what is the normal period for menstruation to be missed	Most women have between 11 and 13 menstrual periods each year. You may be different: You may have more or fewer. Missed or irregular periods must be looked at in terms of what is normal for you. Menstrual periods are often irregular during the first few years after menstruation starts. It may take several years for the hormones that control menstruation to reach a balance. Menopause occurs when it has been 12 months since you had a menstrual period. Pregnancy is the most common cause of a missed period. If you might be pregnant, treat yourself as if you are pregnant until you know for sure. Use a home pregnancy test as the first step to finding out whether you are pregnant. If you are not pregnant, other causes of missed or irregular periods include:References. A menstrual cycle is the time from the day a menstrual period starts to the time the next period starts. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. However, a normal cycle can be shorter or longer than this. It may be anywhere from 21 to 35 days long. Most periods last 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal. Menstrual cycles may happen around the same date every month or they may be irregular. A menstrual period is considered late if it hasn’t started 5 or more days after the day you expected it to start. 
what kingdom is the grafted cactus	A cactus (plural: cacti, cactuses, or cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae within the order Caryophyllales. The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos, a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by long drought periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called  crassulacean acid metabolism  (CAM) as part of photosynthesis.Gymnocalycium mihanovichii, often called chin cactus, is a species of cactus from South America commonly grown as a houseplant. The most popular cultivars are varied mutants which completely lack chlorophyll, exposing the red, orange or yellow pigmentation. These cultivars are often called moon cactus. Even the best grafts only last a few years, as the base grows faster than the Gymnocalycium. After that point, the difference in speed between the two becomes too great for the graft to hold together, and the two split apart. However, you can regraft the scion back on to the rootstock after this.
difference between insurance company and assurance company	Life Assurance is different. It is a hybrid mix of investment and insurance. A Life Assurance policy pays out a sum equal to the higher of either a guaranteed minimum underwritten by the policy's insurance provisions or its investment valuation. This is because with most insurance companies, an additional terminal bonus is awarded. There is a also a specialised form of life assurance called Whole of Life. These policies remain in force for as long as you live and as such, have no preset term. There is also a practical difference for the internet user.by olivia. Insurance vs Assurance. Insurance and Assurance sounding similar; the words insurance and Assurance are commonly used by companies selling financial products. The two terms Insurance and Assurance are very confusing in financial world. When it comes to choosing financial products from insurance companies to safeguard interests of a person or an object, many companies prefer to use the word assurance as against insurance used by others. Both insurance and assurance are financial products offered by companies operating commercially but of late the distinction between the two has increasingly become blurred and the two are taken to be somewhat similar. However, there are subtle differences between the two which are as follow
what is a volvulus	Volvulus: Abnormal twisting of a portion of the gastrointestinal tract, usually the intestine, which can impair blood flow. Volvulus can lead to gangrene and death of the involved segment of the. gastrointestinal tract, intestinal obstruction, perforation of the intestine, and peritonitis. Malrotation of the bowel during fetal development can predispose one to a volvulus, which often has a sudden onset. The symptoms and signs of a volvulus may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and blood in the stool. The treatment is surgery to free the obstruction and ensure normal blood flow to the bowel. Volvulus is a surgical emergencyThe term volvulus has its roots from medieval Latin volvere; which means 'to roll'. A volvulus is a subtype of malrotation, in which a loop of bowel is twisted about a focal point along the mesentery attached to the intestinal tract, that may result in a bowel obstruction. A volvulus is a twisting or axial rotation of a portion of bowel about its mesentery. Sigmoid volvulus is the most-common form of volvulus of the gastrointestinal tract. and is responsible for 8% of all intestinal obstructions. Sigmoid volvulus is particularly common in elderly persons and constipated patients. Patients experience abdominal pain, distension, and absolute constipation.
what color is normal cat urine	Healthy Kidneys. Your cat's kidneys keep him healthy by flushing toxins out through his urine. Every drop of blood in your cat's body is pumped through the kidneys for filtering to prevent the buildup of toxic substances that result from the normal metabolite process. Urine that's brown or red contains blood and could point to a problem with his kidneys. He could have kidney stones or an infection, or he could suffer from kidney disease. In you notice any change in your cat's urine or litter box usage, call your vet.Urine Amount: this depends on how much your cat is drinking and if the kidney if functioning properly (renal health). Cat Urine color: cat urine is usually yellow or amber. If the urine is cloudy and red it indicates that there is blood in the urine. 1  Dark red or brown urine: Indicates blood in the urine. 2  Yellow-brown, greenish: yellow, dark brown, foam: may indicate some type of liver problem. 3  Pink, blue, other colors: may be due to drugs your cat is taking. Disease may still exist in feline urine that has a normal appearance. Feline Urine Transparency (turbidity) : Normal urine is clear. If it isn't clear it could indicate some type of disease is present. Cat Urine odor: Smell such as a strong ammonia like odor might indicate a bacterial infection (sepsis).
hemoglobin levels for a dog	In some anemias, the actual number of RBC's may not be real low, but if the cells contain less than the normal amount of hemoglobin, the signs of anemia could be quite severe. The normal hemoglobin level for a dog is 14-20 grams/deciliter, and 9-15.6 g/dl for cats. White Blood Cells. The other major type of blood cells are the white blood cells (WBC’s), which are also referred to as leukocytes. There are many more RBC’s than there are WBC’s. Each laboratory has their own set of 'normal' ranges for a RBC count, but the average is 5.6-8.7 x 10 6 RBC's per microliter for dogs, and 6.1-11.9 x 10 6 /µ l for cats. Hemoglobin: A final way we can evaluate the RBC's is by quantifying the amount of hemoglobin present.1 High levels of hemoglobin usually indicate high red blood cell counts and dehydration. 2  Low levels indicate anemia, bleeding or iron deficiency. 3  HCT is an abbreviation for hematocrit. 4  The hematocrit is a calculated percentage of red blood cells in the circulation. 1 MCHC is an abbreviation for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. 2  This is the average percentage of hemoglobin in each red blood cell. 3  A high MCHC indicates that there is too much hemoglobin in the red blood cell, indicating a high iron level since an important component of hemoglobin is iron.

lev vygotsky scaffolding definition	The zone of proximal development, often abbreviated as ZPD, is the difference between what a learner can do without help and what he or she can do with help. It is a concept introduced, yet not fully developed, by Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934) during the last ten years of his life. Vygotsky stated that a child follows an adult's example and gradually develops the ability to do certain tasks without help. Since Vygotsky's original conception, the definition for the zone of proximal development has been expanded and modified. The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a skill set higher than that of the subject.Vygotsky provides us with a Social Cognitive Learning Theory that we can apply to education. Two critical concepts of his theory include the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), and Instructional scaffolding. The ZPD is a range of tasks that are within a child’s cognitive ability to learn with assistance. Zone of proximal development  (ZPD) is Vygotsky’s term for the range of tasks that a child is in the process of learning to complete. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child’s actual developmental level).
gravity fed chicken water system	Before we left on our recent road trip, we wanted to have a system in place to water the chickens so the neighbor who would be collecting the eggs wouldn’t have to deal with our problematic hanging waterers. I’d been planning such a system for some time. The new waterer would be gravity fed, so I needed a bit of elevation. We might also want to mount the waterer inside the coop, so the tank stand needed to be high enough to feed into the coop, but low enough that we could collect rainwater off the coop roof (ala pile of o’melays). This stand is just under 3′ tallThe system is based on these. They are poultry drinking nipples. They work just like a water bottle for a hamster. The chicken pecks at the nipple and drops of water come out. I chose the saddle-style nipples rather than the kind that are threaded and screw in because the saddle-style ones are easier to work with. They can be removed, replaced and reused. The screw-in kind can be replaced, but not reused. In the photo, the nipples are pointing up. During use, they will be straight down. Richard used a section of 2x4 to mount the PVC pipe on the wall of the coop. Once the bulkhead tap is opened, water flows through the black hose and into the PVC pipe. When a chicken pecks at one of the drinking nipples, water drips out.
what unit of measure is used for an antibody titers	An antibody titer is a measurement of how much antibody an organism has produced that recognizes a particular epitope, expressed as the inverse of the greatest dilution that still gives a positive result. ELISA is a common means of determining antibody titers. If a few weeks later the same patient had an indirect Coombs titer of 32 (1/32 dilution which is 1 part serum to 31 parts diluent), this would mean that she was making more anti-Rh antibody, since it took a greater dilution to abolish the positive test. There are two main kinds of titer testing that one can do. First there is the physical titer; this titer gives one the concentration of virus particles per unit of measurement. The second way to measure viral titers is to perform an infectious titer levelTiter. In the clinical laboratory, titer is a unit of measurement. It is most often thought of as the lowest dilution of a substance in which a reaction takes place. It is usually expressed as a ratio (i.e., 1:20). For example, serum containing an antibody can be diluted with saline in a serial manner producing dilutions 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, etc. If the lowest dilution that a reaction can still be detected between the antibody and the antigen it is directed against is 1:20, then that is the result of the antibody titer.

While a salary certificate is issued for the period employed in a financial year, the latter is issued with respect to a specific month only.
what is codec	2) The term codec is also an acronym that stands for  co mpression/ dec ompression.. A codec is an algorithm, or specialized computer program, that reduces the number of bytes consumed by large files and programs. In order to minimize the amount of storage space required for a complicated file, such as a video, compression is used. Compression works by eliminating redundancies in data. 1) In communications engineering, the term codec is used in reference to integrated circuits, or chip s that perform data conversion. In this context, the term is an acronym for  co der/ dec oder.. This type of codec combines analog-to-digital conversion and digital-to-analog conversion functions in a single chipCodec. 1. Short for COmpression / DECompression, a codec is an algorithm or special computer program that reduces the number of bytes consumed by large files. Codecs are often used with videos distributed over the Internet; allowing what would normally be a very large video file to be much smaller. One of our most recommended codec pack is the CCCP also known as the Combined Community Codec Pack you can find this download on their web page. Also, Free-Codecs.com is another great collection under Codec Pack All in 1. Finally, a great list of hundreds of different codecs is found on fourcc.
what does a urobilinogen test detect	Urobilinogen in urine. When abnormal values of urobilinogen is found during a urine test, further investigation is required to ascertain your true health status. Using a urine test is a quick and inexpensive way to check for urobilinogen in your urine, and is one of our test kit products that can be done in the privacy of your home. A negative result at any time does not preclude the absence of urobilinogen. In addition, the test cannot be used to detect porphobilinogen. High concentrations of p-aminosalicylic acid and sulphonamides may obscure test patch color. Nitrite, isonicotinic acid (INH) and indole have little or no effect on the testTo detect the type of damage in the liver, urobilinogen tests are conducted by measuring uribilinogen levels in the urine. Ehrlich Aldehyde Reaction is a common test that is used to test Urobilinogen levels. A benzaldehyde in the presence of acid changes the color if urobilinogen is present to pinkish red color. Altered or the complete absence of urobilinogen levels usually indicates a dysfunction of Liver. Failure to take these recommended tests can prove fatal as liver is directly associated with urine and our excretory system. Urobilinogen test is one such test which finds out any defects and faults present in the liver or its operations.
what does landslides causes	A landslide is any geologic process in which gravity causes rock, soil, artificial fill or a combination of the three to move down a slope. Several things can trigger landslides, including the slow weathering of rocks as well as soil erosion, earthquakes and volcanic activity.Those tsunamis were of the ordinary type, seismic tsunamis caused by earthquakes that suddenly lift or drop the seafloor. But a second type of tsunami can arise from landsliding with or without an earthquake, and shorelines of every kind, even lakes on land, are susceptible. 1  Landslide tsunamis are harder to predict, harder for scientists to model and harder to defend against. Landslide Tsunamis and Earthquakes. Landslides of various kinds can push water around. Mountains may crumble to the sea, as the song goes. Mudslides may plop into lakes and reservoirs. And land that lies entirely beneath the waves may fail. In all cases, the landslide material displaces water, and the water responds in very large waves that spread rapidly out in all directions. Many landslides occur during earthquakes, so landslides can complicate seismic tsunamis. The Grand Banks earthquake in eastern Canada on 18 November 1929 was tolerable, but the ensuing tsunami killed 28 people and ruined the economy of southern Newfoundland.
why is she called a fallen monument in the first paragraph	Why is she called a fallen monument in the first paragraph?Women of the Old South and of a good family were often put on pedestals as paragons of virtue and respectability and given special... Their old colonial mansions fell to the ground and into oblivion. The old mannerisms, customs, and traditions of old were also succumbing to the changing times. Emily, like those old, strong plantations, was a thing of the past gone awry. She is a vestige, a symbol of a past that will not return. She is a fallen monument for that same reason: All that defined her and put her in the pedestal of Old Southern magnificence is now gone forever, and she is unable to move on from it. Ask a question. We’ve answered 396,634 questionsBriefly, in Faulkner’s “A Rose for Emily” the main character, Miss Emily Grierson (click here for a full character analysis of Miss Emily), is described in great detail by a local narrator who provides a very personally nuanced and chronologically disjointed narrative. Frustrated with school and hoping to find his own path in life, Faulkner left high school and joined the Canadian Air Force, which allowed him to travel. Upon his travels, he met the writer Sherwood Andersen who also wrote regional fiction (Winesburg Ohio for instance) and was encouraged to keep writing.
what chemicals are in sparklers	A variety of chemicals can be added to create colors. The fuel and oxidizer are proportioned, along with the other chemicals, so that the sparkler burns slowly rather than exploding like a firecracker. Once one end of the sparkler is ignited, it burns progressively to the other end. Sometimes sparklers are called 'snowballs' in reference to the ball of sparks that surrounds the burning part of the sparkler. Sparkler Chemistry. A sparkler consists of several substances: 1  An oxidizer. 2  A fuel.Sulfur-Sulfur is a component of black powder. It is found in a firework's propellant/fuel. Strontium-Strontium salts impart a red color to fireworks. Strontium compounds are also important for stabilizing fireworks mixtures. Titanium-Titanium metal can be burned as powder or flakes to produce silver sparks. The heat of the metal determines the color of the sparks. Lithium-Lithium is a metal that is used to impart a red color to fireworks. Lithium carbonate, in particular, is a common colorant. Magnesium-Magnesium burns a very bright white, so it is used to add white sparks or improve the overall brilliance of a firework. Oxygen-Fireworks include oxidizers, which are substances that produce oxygen in order for burning to occur. The oxidizers are usually nitrates, chlorates, or perchlorate

how to calculate calories in carbohydrates	Step 2. Convert calorie targets into grams of fat, protein and carbohydrates. For a 2,000 calorie diet and the desired 30/20/50 distribution, this amounts to 600 calories from fat, 400 from protein and 1,000 from carbohydrates. Each gram of fat contains 9 calories, so this amounts to approximately 67 grams of fat per day. Protein and carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram, so this plan allots 100 grams of protein and 250 grams of carbohydrates. Step 3. Look up the nutrition information for all of the foods you eat. Measure the number of servings of each food item you consume. Use measuring cups or a scale to calculate how many servings of each food item you consume. Step 5. Multiply the amount of fat, protein and carbohydrates in one serving of every food item you consume by the number of servings you ate.How to calculate calories on a food label. The following box is sometimes shown on a food label. It tells you there are 9 calories in 1 gram of fat, 4 calories in 1 gram of carbohydrate, and 4 grams in 1 gram of protein…always. Fat, carbohydrates, and protein are the only nutrients that contribute calories to food.Add up the calories from these three nutrients to get the total calories shown on the label. 1  1 gram of fat = 9 calories. 2  1 gram of carbohydrates = 4 calorie
myoglobin normal range	Serum concentration of myoglobin increases above the normal range as early as 1 hour after myocardial infarction, and peak in approximately 4 to 8 hours after onset. Therefore, myoglobin is better suited for the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 3. As with all diagnostic tests, a definitive clinical diagnosis should not be based on the result of a single test, but should only be made by the physician after all clinical and labor atory findings have been evaluated. EXPECTED VALUES Normal serum myoglobin levels range from 30 to 90 ng/ml. After 1 hour of the onset of myocardial infarction, serum myoglobin level can elevate to 200 ng/ml or even higher. During the peak hour, myoglobin level can be as high as 900 ng/ml. The level of myoglobin usually returns to normal 12 hours after the onset of the myocardial infarctionLevels of myoglobin start to rise within 2-3 hours of a heart attack or other muscle injury, reach their highest levels within 8-12 hours, and generally fall back to normal within one day. If the myoglobin test is available, it may be ordered to assess persons with chest pain who are suspected of having a heart attack. Blood samples are drawn on admission and every 2-3 hours for up to 12 hours in those who come to the emergency room with a possible
what type of diabetic med is starlix	Starlix is part of a group of diabetes medications called meglitinides. A meglitinide helps the pancreas make more insulin, which helps to lower blood sugar. Another type of diabetes medications, called sulfonylureas (see Starlix Alternatives) , also helps the pancreas make more insulin. However, unlike sulfonylureas, Starlix is short-acting and is used to lower blood sugar levels after meals. Side effects are possible, such as low blood sugar, flu-like symptoms, and dizziness. Starlix ® (nateglinide) is a prescription medication that is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes).Starlix is an oral diabetes medicine that helps control blood sugar levels. Starlix helps your body respond better to insulin produced by your pancreas. Starlix is used together with diet and exercise to treat type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes. Other diabetes medicines are sometimes used in combination with if needed. Important information about Starlix. Do not use Starlix if you are allergic to nateglinide, if you have type 1 diabetes, or if you are in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment with insulin). Starlix is only part of a complete program of treatment that also includes diet, exercise, and weight control
cost to hydroseed	Hydroseeding is a process used to produce turf in a significantly short time at costs lower than sod. Hydroseeding applications are not the same, and the rates used to produce the ideal seed germination vary by mix or blend and other factors. 1 Optional items like tackifier and tumersan are also offered. 2  Tackifier, a substance used to help hydroseed adhere to landscape, costs $0.01 per sq. ft. ($75 min.). 3  Tumersan, pre-emergent weed control, costs $0.01 per sq.ft.A hydroseeded lawn costs an average of $.50-1.00 per square foot with an additional $2 per square foot for the sprinkler system. Hydroseed is more cost-effective for large areas than it is for small ones, since it takes the same amount of time to set up the hydroseeder for a large area as it does for a small one. A hydroseed lawn is an inexpensive, efficient alternative to using sod in areas where a living lawn is desired. However, it’s not without drawbacks. Any kind of seeded lawn takes more maintenance to establish than sod. Learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of choosing a hydroseeded lawn. 1 No cost savings on small lawns-While hydroseeding is a cost-saving choice for large areas, the initial time and expense of getting the hydroseed machine set up means that you don’t save much money on small lawns.
what region is argyll on whisky map	A local government district called Argyll and Bute was formed in the Strathclyde region, including most of Argyll and the Isle of Bute. The Ardnamurchan, Ardgour, Ballachulish, Duror, Glencoe, Kinlochleven and Morvern areas of Argyll were detached to become parts of Lochaber District, in Highland. At present, Argyll (sometimes anglicised as Argyllshire) is also one of the registration counties of Scotland. Argyll was also a medieval bishopric with its cathedral at Lismore, as well as an early modern earldom and dukedom, the Dukedom of Argyll.Argyll and Bute, the council region situated on the Western Scotland was formed in 1996 out of the Strathclyde zone.

what is taski detergent	All organic detergent ingredients, such as the surfactants and enzymes, are biodegradable. This means that they can be broken down by bacteria in the environment. However, bacteria can also infiltrate detergent containers and cause the detergent to spoil during storage. There are three main types of surfactants used in laundry detergents: anionic, non-ionic and cationic. Anionic surfactants have a negatively charged polar head group. The negative charge of this head group is usually balanced by the sodium cation (Na +), arising from the manufacturing procedure.TASKI TR 103 is a carpet detergent for deep cleaning of carpets and upholstery with the injection extraction method and for removal of spots and stains. Its highly effective cleaning properties easily remove water-soluble and greasy oil. In this method the carpet shampoo is converted into dry foam with the help of a foam generator which loosens the dirt particles on the carpet fibers and encases them. These can be then easily removed with the help of a vacuum cleaner. TASKI TR 101. TASKI TR 101 is the chemical shampoo used for dry shampooing. It is a pH-neutral, pleasantly scented, concentrated carpet shampoo for interim cleaning of all types of carpets and upholstery. The consistent dry foam cleans gently yet effectively

what structure do cytoplasm not need	The cytoplasm also hosts a variety of cellular processes, such as glycolysis, which is the first step in cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is how your body makes energy from food. Cell division also occurs in the cytoplasm as well as the synthesis of polypeptides (the molecules that make up proteins). Cytoplasm is the fluid that fills cells and serves several important functions. Cytoplasm holds the internal components of cells in place and protects them from damage. Cytoplasm stores molecules used for cellular processes, as well as hosts many of these processes within the cell itself.cytoplasm. Cytoplasm is a thick solution that fills each cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is mainly composed of water, salts, and proteins. In eukaryotic cells, the cytoplasm includes all of the material inside the cell and outside of the nucleus. All of the organelles in eukaryotic cells, such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, are located in the cytoplasm. The portion of the cytoplasm that is not contained in the organelles is called the cytosol. Although cytoplasm may appear to have no form or structure, it is actually highly organized. A framework of protein scaffolds called the cytoskeleton provides the cytoplasm and the cell with their structure. 
what is the function of duodenum in human body	Together with the jejunum, and the ileum it forms the small intestine. It is connected to the stomach above and the jejunum below it. When food enters the duodenum, there are multiple feed-back pathways and nervous reflexes that will affect how fast the stomach empties as well as the secretion of other hormones. The duodenum plays an important role in regulating the emptying of stomach contents into the small intestine. When chyme enters the duodenum, it acts as a stimulant for the release of secretin and cholecystokinin which are released by the epithelial cell walls of the duodenum.Many chemical secretions from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix with the chyme in the duodenum to facilitate chemical digestion. Located inferior to the stomach, the duodenum is a 10-12 inch (25-30 cm) long C-shaped, hollow tube. The duodenum is a part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, attached to the pyloric sphincter of the stomach on its superior end and to the jejunum of the small intestine on its inferior end.... Click to read more below. The duodenum is the first and shortest segment of the small intestine. It receives partially digested food (known as chyme) from the stomach and plays a vital role in the chemical digestion of chyme in preparation for absorption in the small intestin

what is variation in genetics	Genetic variation is a fact that a biological system – individual and population – is different over space. It is the base of the genetic variability of different biological systems in space. Genetic variation is based on the variation in alleles of genes in a gene pool. It occurs both within and among populations, supported by individual carriers of the variant genes. Genetic variation is brought about by random mutation, which is a permanent change in the chemical structure of a gene. Random mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation. Mutations are likely to be rare and most mutations are neutral or deleterious, but in some instances the new alleles can be favored by natural selection.1 Mutations are changes in the DNA. 2  A single mutation can have a large effect, but in many cases, evolutionary change is based on the accumulation of many mutations. 3  Gene flow is any movement of genes from one population to another and is an important source of genetic variation. There are three primary sources of genetic variation, which we will learn more about: 1  Mutations are changes in the DNA. 2  Gene flow is any movement of genes from one population to another and is an important source of genetic variation. 3  Sex can introduce new gene combinations into a population.
what is process modelling used for	Business Process Modelling techniques are concerned with 'mapping' and 'workflow' to enable understanding, analysis and positive change. Diagrams-essentially 'flow diagrams' - are a central feature of the methodology. The diagrammatical representation of Business Process Modelling is commonly called 'notation'. The term Business Process Model (also abbreviated to BPM) is the noun form of Business Process Modelling, and refers to a structural representation, description or diagram, which defines a specified flow of activities in a particular business or organisational unit. (N.B. US-English spelling is 'organization'.Process models are processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model. Thus, a process model is a description of a process at the type level. Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it. The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations. One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.
quadrat method of estimating population	Estimation of Population Size and Density from Quadrat Samples When the population that we are investigating is contained within an area, we can take a random sample of areas, estimate the population density and then estimate the population total. This looks much like approaches we have taken previously, but with an extra assumption some of the calculations are easier. Suppose our total area is A and can be subdivided into N plots (quadrats) each of size a, so that A = Na. Now if we take a random sample of n plots, and mi are the number of elements from the population in plot i, then M = PN i=1 mi is the total size of the population and ‚ = M=A is the density of the population. We will estimate ‚ and then use it to obtain an estimator of M. If our sample mean of elements per plot is m = 1 n Pn i=1 mi, then we can obtain the following estimators of ‚;M, and a variance estimator using SRS theory: b‚ = m a;Mc= ‚A;b and Vb(b‚) = 1 a2 s2 m n: So far there is nothing new here.

what are some fossil fuels	A fossil-fuel power station is a power station which burns fossil fuel such as coal, natural gas or petroleum to produce electricity. Central station fossil-fuel power plants are designed on a large scale for continuous operation. In many countries, such plants provide most of the electrical energy used. In a fossil fuel power plant the chemical energy stored in fossil fuels such as coal, fuel oil, natural gas or oil shale and oxygen of the air is converted successively into thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy. Each fossil fuel power plant is a complex, custom-designed system.Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include coal, petroleum and natural gas. Other more commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane. Although fossil fuels are continually being formed via natural processes, they are generally considered to be non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made.
why are psychopaths so dangerous	The victim quickly likes and then trusts the psychopath and so the mind control begins. They can be charming, witty and seem intelligent, talking easily about a range of topics. They seem friendly and understanding and may be the life and soul of a party. But for them it's all about impression management. Understanding a psychopath. Robert Hare and Paul Babiak in their book 'Snakes in Suits' describes how the socialised psychopath will present themselves as the perfect partner by noticing the victim's needs, insecurities, and strengths as well as weaknesses in order to create a persona that seems ideal to the victim.Why some violent criminals are more likely than others to offend again. Violent offenders who are also psychopaths are so dangerous because their brains do not learn normally from either punishments or rewards, a new study finds. Published in The Lancet Psychiatry, the research scanned the brains of violent offenders, some of whom were psychopaths, others not (Gregory et al., 2015). “One in five violent offenders is a psychopath. They have higher rates of recidivism and don’t benefit from rehabilitation programmes. Our research reveals why this is and can hopefully improve childhood interventions to prevent violence and behavioural therapies to reduce recidivism.”.
is axillary appendicular	In the human skeleton, it consists of 80 bones and is composed of eight parts; the skull bones, the ossicles of the middle ear, the hyoid bone, the rib cage, sternum and the vertebral column. The axial skeleton together with the appendicular skeleton form the complete skeleton. Another definition of axial skeleton is the bones including the vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, ribs, and sternum. The human axial skeleton consists of 80 different bones. It is the medial core of the body and connects the pelvis to the body, where the appendix skeleton attaches. As the skeleton grows older the bones get weaker with the exception of the skull. The skull remains strong to protect the brain from injury.The axial consists of the skull, vertebral column, sacrum, coccyx, ribs, and sternum. And, the appendicular skeletal system … is composed of the bones of the arms and legs. the appendicular skeleton is the limbs and limb girdles that are attached to the axial skeleton and the axial skeleton is the head and trunk.

what does bogan mean	In Australia we have a sub culture called “Bogan”. You can be a bogan or more acceptably, you will want to accuse others of being a bogan without actually admitting any of the traits in yourself. A bogan is sort of like a rullnock but not quite. To be a bogan is to be the most quintessentially Australian you can be. It is to take every Australian stereotype of Paul Hogan, The Crocodile Hunter (what was his name again?), Kylie Minogue, Dame Edna Everage and Skippy the Bush Kangaroo and times it by 1000. The bogan is the most Australia and often most obnoxious, an Australian can be. While browsing the Internet the other day I came across this photo collection from what must be one of Australia’s biggest bogans and it makes for the perfect example.The term bogan (/ˈboʊɡən/) is an Australian and New Zealand slang word that can be used to describe a person with a lower working-class background, or whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour exemplify a gratified working class mentality and depending on the context, can be pejorative or self-deprecating. In 2007, Microsoft deemed bogan to be one of twenty colloquialisms most relevant to Australian users when the word was added to the dictionary of Microsoft Office 2007. The word entered the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2012.
what foods contain collagen	Red fruits and vegetables also are excellent sources to up the collagen content of foods in the diet. The presence of lycopenes in these types of foods helps to act as antioxidants, which in turn increases collagen production. Try adding rep peppers, beets, and fresh or stewed tomatoes to the diet. For a snack that promotes healthy production of collagen, try making an avocado dip. Avocados contain the same omega fatty acids as fish, and digest just as easily. Foods that are rich in sulfur content are also important to collagen production. Among these are green and black olives, fresh cucumbers, and fresh stalks of celery. Working in conjunction with the sulfur, vegetables that are rich in Vitamin A also aid in keeping collagen levels highVegetables. Much like fruits, the best vegetable choices for aiding in the production of collagen are high in vitamin C as well as vitamin K. Select foods like red peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, sweet bell peppers, beets, eggplant, purple asparagus, endive, purple cabbage and cauliflower. There are certain foods that aid the body in its production of collagen. Many of these foods can be added into any diet in order to promote better health. Foods that are rich in protein and vitamins K and C are perfect for aiding in the
causes of decreased tone	Description. Hypotonia, also called floppy infant syndrome or infantile hypotonia, is a condition of decreased muscle tone. The low muscle tone can be caused by a variety of conditions and is often indicative of the presence of an underlying central nervous system disorder, genetic disorder, or muscle disorder. Muscle tone is the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle. Definition. Hypotonia, or severely decreased muscle tone, is seen primarily in children. Low-toned muscles contract very slowly in response to a stimulus and cannot maintain a contraction for as long as a normal muscle. Hypotonia is a symptom that can be caused by many different conditions.Hypotonia is a medical term used to describe decreased muscle tone. Normally, even when relaxed, muscles have a very small amount of contraction that gives them a springy feel and provides some resistance to passive movement. It is not the same as muscle weakness, although the two conditions can co-exist. Muscle tone is regulated by signals that travel from the brain to the nerves and tell the muscles to contract. Hypotonia can happen from damage to the brain, spinal cord, nerves, or muscles. The damage can be the result of trauma, environmental factors, or genetic, muscle, or central nervous system disorders.
what is c diff infection	1 Clostridium difficile colitis is an infection of the colon by the bacterium, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). 2  C. difficile causes colitis by producing toxins that damage the lining of the colon. 3  The symptoms of C. difficile colitis are fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 1 The symptoms of C. difficile colitis are fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 2  Serious complications of C. difficile colitis include dehydration, rupture of the colon, and spread of infection to the abdominal cavity or body. 3  Severe infection is life-threateningClostridium difficile (C. difficile, or C. diff) is a specific kind of bacterial infection that causes mild to life-threatening forms of diarrhea and colitis. It is caused by a bacteria, not a virus. Once you’re infected, it’s very easy to spread C. diff bacteria from one person to another, though it’s primarily spread between people by dirty hands and not washing hands before food preparation and eating. Click here for more info. C. difficile is a spore forming bacteria. A spore is a hard shell that some types of bacteria can wear to protect themselves in harsh environments for long periods of time (think of a seed). This hard shell makes C. difficile more difficult to treat, harder to clean, and easier to become contagious to other
what is ramie material	Ramie fibre is white and lustrous and looks like silk, but it lacks stretch and elasticity. Extremely absorbent, much more than cotton, ramie fabric breathes well and makes comfortable clothing for warm and humid summers. Ramie is one of the strongest natural fibres and it is strong even when wet. Like linen, it will break if folded repeatedly in the same place, so avoid pressing sharp creases or folding ramie fabric. Ramie fabric does not shrink and it is resistant to bacteria and mildew, which means it does not rot easily. c) Uses for Ramie fibre. Pure ramie can be spun into a fine yarn either dry or wet. You will find it very similar to spinning tussah silk, and when there is static electricity, the fibre clings to your clothes. Ramie is one of the strongest natural fibers. It exhibits even greater strength when wet. Ramie fiber is known especially for its ability to hold shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a silky lustre to the fabric appearance. It is not as durable as other fibers, and so is usually used as a blend with other fibers such as cotton or wool. It is a bast fiber, and the part used is the bark (phloem) of the vegetative stalks. Ramie is normally harvested two to three times a year but under good growing conditions can be harvested up to six times per year.

where in the body is smooth er found in abundance	Smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types and it serves different functions in each. It consists of tubules and vesicles that branch forming a network. In some cells there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows increased surface area for the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes. In the case of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells, the vesicles and tubules serve as a store of calcium which is released as one step in the contraction process. Calcium pumps serve to move the calcium.Rough ER is mainly found near the nucleus and the Golgi apparatus, whereas smooth ones extend to the periphery of the cell. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes, which give the granular appearance. The smooth ER has very few or no ribosomes. Proportion: The proportion of smooth endoplasmic reticulum is very small, when compared to that of rough ER. Smooth ER is mostly found in cells that are actively involved in synthesis and metabolism of lipids. It is prominently seen in the liver, ovaries, testes, muscles, etc. In short, smooth endoplasmic reticulum is primarily meant for storage and transport of lipids and protein
pet waste in water causes	Do You Scoop The Poop? It’s Pet waste doesn’t just decompose. It adds harmful bacteria and nutrients to local waters, when it’s not disposed of properly. It might not seem like a stormwater problem, but animal waste is one of the many seemingly small sources of pollution that can add up to big problems for water quality, and even human health. Animal waste contains two main types of pollutants that harm local waters: nutrients and pathogens. When this waste ends up in water bodies, it decomposes, releasing nutrients that cause excessive growth of algae and weeds. This makes the water murky, green, smelly, and even unusable for swimming, boating, or fishing. The pathogens, disease-5 Important Reasons to Clean up Pet Waste By Drs.

which muscle cells are involuntary	Involuntary muscles are muscles that are not controllable consciously, and instead contract due to unconscious impulses sent by the autonomic nervous system or certain specialized cells or hormones. Both smooth muscle and cardiac muscle can be classified as involuntary muscles. Smooth muscle is comprised of spindle-shaped cells that have no striations and is found in numerous locations throughout the human body. Cardiac muscle is striated rather than smooth, and is found only within the walls of the heart. A beating heart is one of the best examples of an involuntary muscle. Contractions of cardiac muscles push blood through the four chambers of the human heart. The process of peristalsis, which pushes food through the esophagus and small intestine, is controlled byMuscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. Muscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis. There are three types of muscle, skeletal or striated, cardiac, and smooth. Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary
what does it mean when a compound is ionic	Best Answer: In the simplest terms: If a compound is covalent it means that it has covalent bonds holding the substance together, in other words, the compound is formed between two non metals and involves the sharing of electrons. Report Abuse. ionic means that one element loses one or more electrons to another, and then there are electrostatic attractions between the two (or more) ions. Happens only between a metal and non-metal covalent means that 2 elements share one or more electrons, and these electrons are attracted by both nuclei.Ionic compound. In chemistry, an ionic compound is a chemical compound in which ions are held together in a lattice structure by ionic bonds. Usually, the positively charged portion consists of metal cations and the negatively charged portion is an anion or polyatomic ion. Thus, in an ionic bond, one 'bonder' must have a positive charge and the other a negative one. By sticking to each other, they resolve, or partially resolve, their separate charge imbalances. Positive to positive and negative to negative ionic bonds do not occur. Chemical compounds are never strictly ionic. Even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as caesium fluoride exhibit a degree of covalency. Similarly, covalent compounds often exhibit charge separations
what is the purpose of a luna moth	Luna Moths are members of the Saturniidae family, also known as the Giant Silkworm Moths.. Luna Moths are huge moths, with a wingspan of four and a half inches. They have a white body, pinkish legs, and huge pale green wings. The hindwings have eyespots and long tails. They fly, only at night, in Spring and early Summer. The female Luna Moth lays eggs on the bottom of Black Walnut leaves. They only live for about a week, and their only purpose is to mate. The caterpillars will continue to eat and grow, molting their skins as they grow. They will do this five times over a period of three to four weeks. When the caterpillar is fully grown, it will be 2 1/2 inches long and ready to become a pupa.Luna moths are attracted to the moon as a source of light. In spiritual terms, they signify rebirth and new beginnings. Because they gravitate towards light in the darkness of the night, the luna moth is seen as a symbol of spiritual transformation, of heightened awareness, and a striving towards truth.. This is a male Luna Moth (not 'Lunar moth'); only the fourth I've ever seen in 60 years. Luna moths are native to North America, and not so much rare as secretive. These are forest-dwelling, night-flying, short-lived moths. In New England, adults emerge from pupa in late May to mid-June.
how much does a master mechanic make	Automotive Mechanics. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the median annual salary of an automotive mechanic was $36,710 in 2013, which amounts to $17.65 per hour (www.bls.gov). The top 10% of automotive mechanics and service technicians earned $29.43 or more per hour, while the lowest 10% made an hourly wage of $10.06 or less. Most of these mechanics worked in automotive repair and maintenance shops, auto dealerships and automotive parts stores. The BLS cited that, as of May 2013, bus and truck mechanics and diesel engine specialists received a median annual salary of $42,730, or $20.54 per hour. The middle half of bus and truck mechanics earned between $16.34 and $25.78 hourlyFor example, a mechanic with a BMW certification makes $40,000 a year as a C-tech, the lowest level in the shop. An A-tech, or “master” tech, can earn upward of $120,000 a year, according to Auto Mechanics School. The same can also be said for master technicians servicing Volvos, who earn $60,000 to $100,000 a year. But overtime can increase income, and entry-level master techs earn $18 an hour for overtime. They’re also given bonuses and incentives, which brings the salary up to $35,000 a year, reports the Technician Salary Guide. Of course, as experience increases, so do salaries.

what division/phylum of the gymnosperms contains the oldest plant living on earth	A few other, lesser known gymnosperms exist. They don't look anything like conifers, but they are indeed seed plants without flowers, which makes them gymnosperms. The phylum Cycadophyta, or the cycads, is the oldest group of seed plants. Cycads were widespread when dinosaurs roamed the Earth during the Mesozoic. These days, cycads are found mostly in tropical areas and only about 130 species exist. The most famous gymnosperms are in the Phylum Coniferophyta. We usually just call them conifers, which means cone-bearing.. These are the pines, spruces, firs, sequoias and junipers, and this phylum contains more than 600 species.Phylum Cycadophyta: The Cycad phyla of gymnosperms has a similar appearance to palms, though palms are flowering plants while Cycads are not (1). They are found in tropical and subtropical areas, although some species can live in areas that receive frost.

foods containing titanium dioxide list	The researchers found that 36 percent of the particles in food-grade titanium dioxide are nano-sized; and then tested a variety of products for titanium dioxide and found it in dozens of products, including the ones originally listed in this post. All of which raises the question of safety. Radically miniaturized particles are attractive to the food and textile industries for their novel properties. Nano-size titanium dioxide, for example, is used as a color enhancer—it makes white foods like yogurt and soy milk whiter, and brightens dark products like chocolate.Foodstuffs in developed countries contain increasing quantities of microscopic particles such as titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is used by the millions of tons as a whitening or brightening pigment to make white-colored paint, but also as an additive to make white-colored food. It’s added to food so much so that people eating conventional diets may be ingesting a trillion particles of titanium dioxide every day! Watch my video Titanium Dioxide & Inflammatory Bowel Disease to see the results, but basically they concluded that titanium dioxide may transport inflammatory substances like endotoxin into the gut wall via a ‘Trojan horse’-type mechanism. What happens in a petri dish, however, may not happen in a person.

what is a dubble belgian beer	Belgian Style Dubbel Belgian Style Dubbel. The story of New Belgium begins with an abbey: Not only were Belgium’s monastic beers the inspiration behind our Colorado brewery, but Abbey, a Belgian-style dubbel, was one of the first beers we released way back in 1991.Since then, it’s become our most award-winning offering, and in 2015, we updated the recipe.his garnet brown hued Belgian-style dubbel is strong on character and rich in flavor. Seven malts, including caramel Munich and chocolate, and a definitive Belgian yeast, waft off sweet, spicy aromas. Rich tones of chocolate and dark caramel mix with nuanced dried cherries, burnt sugar and figs.The dubbel (also double) is a Belgian Trappist beer naming convention.The origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle in 1856. The abbey had, since 10 December 1836, brewed a light coloured beer that was quite sweet and light in alcohol for consumption by the monks.The new beer, however, was a strong version of a brown beer.he origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle in 1856.

what are the types of maple trees	Many Types of Maple Trees. Maple trees belong to the genus Acer, and there are 125 species of maple trees. They grace the landscape throughout the world. Most are deciduous, meaning they lose their leaves each fall, but a few native to the warm climates of southern Asia do not shed their leaves. Most maple trees have green leaves, but some may have red or ruby-bronze colored leaves. With 125 species of maple, it would be nearly impossible to list them all. The types of maples gardeners are most likely to encounter in the average home and garden center include: 1  Japanese maple (Acer palmatum). 2  Norway maple (Acer platonoides). 3  Sugar maple (Acer saccharum). 4  Paperbark maple (Acer griseum). 5  Red maple (Acer rubrum)In addition to bonsais, small types of maple trees can be used for ornamental landscaping. Maple is great for ornamental trees because they respond to trimming and can be cut and sculpted into any shape or form you desire. The best ornamental trees tend to be those that are smaller in stature. Different types of maple trees come in dwarf versions that do not over grow and take up little space in your yard. Dwarf trees are a great option for homes and yards with little space because they offer all the attributes of a regular sized plant in a smaller version.
what will it cost for a conveyance solicitor	Professional Fees. The initial fees you pay for a conveyancer or solicitor will depend on the type of professional you choose to hire. In general, a conveyancer’s fees will be lower than a solicitor’s. These could range between $500 and $800. Yet some conveyancers will run special promotions, which might lead you to negotiate an all-inclusive fee. This could include the cost of both professional fees as well as disbursements. For EPA or heritage searches, you can expect to pay a bit more. Another type of cost that this process incurs are settlement fees. These are usually between $30 and $80, depending on the agent that your solicitor or conveyancer uses.Conveyancing for a typical property will cost somewhere between £500 and £1500 for a purchase and sale (less for a single transaction). It breaks down essentially into two parts; what you pay the conveyancer (or solicitor) and what you pay in the way of disbursements (payments to third parties, paid on your behalf). To get several quotations for conveyancing from conveyancers and solicitors who cover your local area, please provide the details requested below. We will then immediately provide a number of estimates online from different suppliers together with their contact details. You will be able to contact them directly.
what is pseudo colitis	Clostridium difficile redirects here. For the bacterium, see Clostridium difficile (bacteria) . Clostridium difficile colitis or pseudomembranous colitis is colitis (inflammation of the large intestine) resulting from infection with Clostridium difficile, a spore-forming bacterium. It causes an infectious diarrhea called C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD). Clostridium difficile is one such type of bacterium. In addition to proliferating in the bowel, C. difficile also produces toxins. Without either toxin A or toxin B, C. difficile may colonize the gut, but is unlikely to cause pseudomembranous colitis. The colitis associated with severe infection is part of an inflammatory reaction, with the pseudomembrane formed by a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cellsinflammation of the colon. There are many types of colitis, each with different etiologies; the differential diagnosis involves the clinical history, stool examinations, sigmoidoscopy, and radiologic studies such as a lower gastrointestinal series. a severe acute inflammation of the bowel mucosa, with the formation of pseudomembranous plaques. It is most commonly associated with antimicrobial therapy (see antibiotic-associated colitis (above)). Called also pseudomembranous enterocolitis.
how long to go through customs at gatwick	On that trip I used both Gatwick and Heathrow airports, as I stayed in London a few days then went on to Madeira, Portugal via Gatwick. When I first arrived from the US, I came into London Gatwick around 8am. The line for customs was miles long and it took about 30 minutes to get through. But when I came into Gatwick around 5pm from Madeira it was a ghost town. I kid you not, there wasn't a soul in the line, and the baggage re-claim area was dead quiet. Last Tuesday, it took 45 minutes to get to an immigration officer through a queue line that would do Disneyland proud...the immigration inspection took oh about 15 seconds, she looked at my landing card, my passport, asked how long I would be in the UK, stamped my passport and said, off you go..Posts: 1,841. Sorry-I did mean immigration and not customs (won't have anything to declare so hopefully won't get stuck in there at all). I also will only have hand luggage (was meant to state in the first post-obviously forgot!). As a UK citizen, you should not have to queue very long. As you will be coming through at a relatively slow time (i.e., not first thing in the morning when lots of transatlantic flights are arriving, nor on a Sunday evening when people are returning from weekends away), processing should be relatively quick.
where does vanilla come from	Vanilla is one of those powerful ingredients we use all the time, but probably take for granted. Whether it's vanilla extract in your chocolate chip cookies or scraped vanilla beans for custard or ice cream, vanilla is called for in all kinds of recipes. With so many uses and so many different types of vanilla -- from Bourbon to Mexican -- vanilla is an omnipresent ingredient whose value cannot be overstated. Vanilla comes from orchids of the genus Vanilla. While the major species of vanilla orchids are now grown around the world, they originally came from Mesoamerica, including parts of modern day Mexico and Guatemala. The vanilla orchid is a vine-like plant that grows up treesVanilla is a flavor derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). The word vanilla, derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning sheath or pod), translates simply as little pod. Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlilxochitl by the Aztecs. 1 Tahitian vanilla is the name for vanilla from French Polynesia, made with the V. tahitiensis strain. 2  Genetic analysis shows this species is possibly a cultivar from a hybrid-cross of V. planifolia and V. odorata.
what is spam food	Spam is a brand of canned precooked meat products made by Hormel Foods Corporation. It was first introduced in 1937 and gained popularity worldwide after its use during World War II. By 2003, Spam was sold in 41 countries on six continents and trademarked in over 100 countries. In 2007, the seven billionth can of Spam was sold. According to its label, Spam's basic ingredients are pork shoulder meat, with ham meat added, salt, water, modified potato starch as a binder, sugar, and sodium nitrite as a preservative. Natural gelatin forms during cooking in its tins on the production line.Background. Spam is a brand name for a canned meat product containing ham, pork, salt, flavorings, and preservatives that are mixed and cooked under vacuum pressure. There are other brands of similar canned pork meat products, but Spam—made by Hormel Foods Corporation—is the original and the best-selling of the brands. The standard Spam can is brick-shaped and holds 7 oz (198 g) of meat. 1 Then, the other ingredients in Spam—salt, sugar, water, and sodium nitrite—are added. 2  The mixer lid is closed, creating an airtight seal, and the batch is mixed. 3  The reason the vacuum is induced, the meat chilled, and the salt added is to reduce the amount of juice released by the meat when it is cooked.
calcium foods what do they do	Calcium is a chemical element which is essential for living organisms, including humans. Calcium's chemical symbol is Ca. It is found in many foods. We need to consume a certain amount of calcium to build and maintain strong bones and healthy communication between the brain and various parts of the body. The National Health Service (NHS) 1, UK, says there is more calcium in the human body than any other mineral. Vitamin D helps our bodies absorb and retain calcium in the bones. According to the NIH (National Institutes of Health) 3, approximately 43% of all American adults take dietary supplements - 70% of adult females do. Users increase their calcium daily intake by about an average of 300 mg per day through supplementsTable 1 shows the amount of calcium in selected foods. When you realize that there is as much or more calcium in 4 ounces of firm tofu or 3/4 cup of collard greens as there is in one cup of cow’s milk, it is easy to see why groups of people who do not drink cow’s milk still have strong bones and teeth. However, other excellent sources of calcium exist. Sources of well-absorbed calcium for vegans include calcium-fortified soy milk and juice, calcium-set tofu, soybeans and soynuts, bok choy, broccoli, collards, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard greens, and okra.
do shrimp cocktails contain a lot of carbs	This includes fish such as salmon, tuna, trout and tilapia and shellfish such as shrimp, crab and oysters. Like all animal foods, shrimp contains ample amounts of protein and can replace meat and poultry as a source of protein in your diet.Shrimp contains all the essential amino acids required for maintaining health and is therefore a source of high-quality protein.hrimp is also a good source of iron, zinc and copper, minerals that are essential for formation of hemoglobin and cell membrane structure as well as for healing of wounds. Shrimp is an excellent source of selenium, a mineral with antioxidant properties that can slow growth of cancer cells and repair DNA.Breaded shrimp have more carbs than plain broiled shrimp. Some types of seafood, including shrimp, have small amounts of carbohydrates. When you bread the shrimp during preparation, you'll add even more carbohydrates.You need some carbohydrates in your diet, however. They metabolize into glucose to power all your cells, particularly brain cells which can only use glucose as a source of energy.Eat breaded shrimp in moderation and prepare them without excess fat to make them a healthy part of your diet.ost of the carbohydrates in breaded shrimp, more than 90 percent, come from starch, a type of complex carbohydrate.

What is the name for the anaerobic process in which glucose is broken down?	Through the metabolic process known as glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate (CH3COCOO- + H+). The energy from this process creates ATP and NADH. Explained: G … lucose is made through photosynthesis which involves CO2+H2O+Energy = C6H12O6 (a.k.a glucose). Cellular respiration is the process of breaking down glucose for energy used by nearly all complex organisms. It breaks glucose into CO2, H2O, and most importantly, energy.In Stage 1 of Cellular Respiration, Glycolysis occurs, where glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm. Both anaerobic and aerobic processes go though glycolysis. During glycolysis, a one six-carbon molecule of glucose is broken down to three-carbon pyruvates with the help of enzymes. Pyruvate is an ion, a molecule that has lost or gained one or more electrons. This ion makes up a three-carbon organic acid called pyruvic acid. An anaerobic process is a process that uses metabolism without air, while an aerobic process is a process that uses metabolism with air. Synopsis of Cellular Respiration. In Cellular Respiration, energy in organic compounds, including glucose, is harnessed. In stage one of Cellular Respiration, glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm through glycolysis, and converted to pyruvate, which produces a small amount of ATP and NADH
how old does a kitten have to be before it can go outside	A kitten needs to stay inside for around 6-9 weeks in order to give the kitten plenty of time to settle in and familiarise itself with its new surroundings before letting it o … utside. Ideally, a kitten should never be let outside until it is 6 to 7 months old at the very earliest. Kittens should be kept indoors until it has had all its vaccinations. This insures that its immune system is ready for the kitten to be let outside where many illnesses can be picked up. Kittens should be let out after they've been spayed so they should be let out when there at least 10 or 12 months old. Younger kittens will simply not be able to fend for them … selves if left to their own devices.It is best not to leave your kitten outside alone until it is 6 months old and it is essential that it is neutered (from 4 months of age) before allowing it unsupervised access. If you have adopted an adult cat you probably will have been advised to keep it in for 2-3 weeks to settle into its new home. Because of potential infection with diseases such as enteritis or cat flu, your kitten should not be allowed outside until at least a week after it has finished its first course of vaccinations at about 13-14 weeks old (depending on the vaccine). You could then let it explore outside if it is supervised.
what is earthy brown pigment called	Umber is a natural earth color with many natural (raw umber, raw sienna) and manmade (burnt umber, burnt sienna) variations, providing painters throughout history with many brown shades to satisfy their visual needs. In the 17th century, another natural earth color came into use, namely Van Dyke brown. Although earthy browns were available for artists’ use, in the 18th and 19th centuries European artists commonly used a brown called mommia that was made from corpses. Symbolism of the Color Brown. The word brown comes from Old English “brun,” brún used for any dusky or dark shade of. Color brown represents. Earthiness while brown might be considered a little dull compared to the other, colors brown also represents, simplicity, health and. dependabilitySienna (from Italian: terra di Siena, Siena ground) is an earth pigment containing iron oxide and manganese oxide. In its natural state, it is yellow-brown and is called raw sienna. When heated, it becomes a reddish brown and is called burnt sienna. Along with ochre and umber, it was one of the first pigments to be used by humans, and is found in many cave paintings. Since the Renaissance, it has been one of the brown pigments most widely used by artists. The first recorded use of sienna as a colour name in English was in 1760.
how far above stove should microwave be mounted	From contributor B: The bottom of the upper cabinets is a standard 54. Add the height of your microwave to determine the bottom of the cabinet over the microwave. This will put the bottom of your microwave at the 54 mark. 16-19 is the going height nowadays for modern microwaves, with 17 being the most common size. The 2006 IRC section 1901.1 requires 30 inches from stove to combustibles unless the stove manufacturer requires more. Comment from contributor O: I just mounted a GE microwave with a vent and it told me to mount at a minimum of 21 above the stove top. Comment from contributor P: I am just into this very problem with a client. The above stove cabinet was ordered for a standard vent hood over an electric stove. They then decided on a gas rangSome manufacturers allow smaller clearances. General Electric, for example, requires that its microwaves be mounted with a minimum of 66 inches between the floor and the top of the microwave, which results in a clearance of between 13 and 16 inches from the microwave to the cooktop. The National Kitchen and Bath Association recommends that the bottom of the microwave should be no higher than 54 inches above the floor, which would allow for 18 inches of clearance between the microwave and the typical cooktop height of 36 inches.
what is severe osteoporosis	The most common cause of osteoporosis pain is a spinal compression fracture. If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, or if you have several risk factors for osteoporosis, these symptoms may indicate a compression fracture 1  : Sudden, severe back pain that gets worse when you are standing or walking. 2  Some pain relief when lying down. Medication to Relieve Osteoporosis Pain. Medication is the most popular way to manage osteoporosis pain. Drugs include: 1  Over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are safe pain relievers for most people. 2  These may cause stomach irritation and bleeding or liver problems.Osteoporosis is a condition that has virtually no symptoms until severe bone damage has already occurred. Once the bones have been weakened by bone density loss, symptoms may include: 1  Back pain. 2  Loss of height over time with stooped posture. 3  Fractures of the vertebrae, wrists, hips or other bones. Without treatment, a person with osteoporosis is likely to have fractures, most often in the spine or hips (which support the body's weight) or in the wrists from bracing against a fall. Fractures of the spine can happen even without a fall or an injury. The bones of the spine become so weak that they start to compress.
what is garlic dietary supplement	Garlic supplements should be standardized for allicin content. In Europe, garlic supplements must have at least 0.45% of this important compound. The recommended dose for people who want to use garlic to protect the heart or improve cardiovascular health is 3 to 5 mg of allicin per day. In addition to its ability to fight infection, garlic may help to lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes, and it is also a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants counter the effects of free radicals, oxygen molecules with unpaired electrons that can cause damage throughout the body if they are not stabilized.Introduction. This fact sheet provides basic information about garlic—common names, what the science says, potential side effects and cautions, and resources for more information. Garlic is the edible bulb from a plant in the lily family. It has been used as both a medicine and a spice for thousands of years. Garlic’s most common folk or traditional uses as a. are for high cholesterol, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Its resources include publications (such as Dietary Supplements: What You Need to Know), fact sheets on a variety of specific supplement ingredients and products (such as vitamin D and multivitamin/mineral supplements), and the PubMed Dietary Supplement Subset.
what determines where on the dna molecule transcription begins	(2) Elongation of the mRNA chain. (3) Termination of the mRNA chain. The piece of mRNA that results from the direct transcription of the DNA that encodes a gene is called the primary transcript and it undergoes modification, sometimes quite extensively, before it can translate its message into protein. The class of enzymes that synthesize RNAs are known as RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase holoenzyme contacts the promoter at roughly the centers of the two regions (-10 and -35) and the core enzyme tightly binds to the duplex DNA. Its action is that of melting the double-stranded DNA along a sequence of about 11 bps, from -9 to +2. The s factor splits off as transcription begins.Transcription & Translation: Transcription (Advanced). Transcription is the process by which the information in DNA is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA) for protein production. Transcription begins with a bundle of factors assembling at the promoter sequence on the DNA (in red). Here, two transcription factors are already bound to the promoter. Here the process begins. Transcription factors assemble at a specific promoter region along the DNA. The length of DNA following the promoter is a gene and it contains the recipe for a protein. A mediator protein complex arrives carrying the enzyme RNA polymerase.

on what does the nervous system relies to transmit a sensation	The sensory nervous system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information. A sensory system consists of sensory receptors, neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Certain receptors are sensitive to certain types of stimuli (for example, different mechanoreceptors respond best to different kinds of touch stimuli, like sharp or blunt objects). Receptors send impulses in certain patterns to send information about the intensity of a stimulus (for example, how loud a sound is).The central nervous system relies on pathways and higher order functions to transfer information to various parts of the brain, giving the body sensory and motor ability. There is a constant interaction going on between the brain, spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Pathways are either ascending (sensory) or descending (motor) and contain tracts and nuclei, where signals from one neuron to another creates a synapse. They are in the skin, joints, muscles and viscera (Noback 155). Sensory systems transmit information regarding intensity. Receptors of pain are called nociceptors. Each of the pathways involve a chain of neurons named accordingly, a first order neuron is a neuron that delivers directly to the CNS or its cell body.
what is katakana	The other script, katakana, is used for indicating loan words from languages like English, animal and plant names, some company names such as Suzuki, to emphasize, for accented speech, for sounds such as animal cries, and in place of some kanji. To see how a particular English word is represented in katakana, try the following tool which converts English into katakana based on a dictionary of pronunciations: Turn English into katakana : The names of animal and plant species and minerals are commonly written in katakana.Katakana (片仮名, カタカナ) is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system along with hiragana, kanji, and in some cases the Latin script (known as romaji). The word katakana means fragmentary kana, as the katakana characters are derived from components of more complex kanji. Katakana and hiragana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, each syllable (strictly mora) in the Japanese language is represented by one character, or kana, in each system. Each kana is either a vowel such as  a  (katakana ア); a consonant followed by a vowel such as  ka  (katakana カ); or  n  (katakana ン), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n, or ng ([ŋ]), or like the nasal vowels of Spanish and/or Portuguese.
cost to run a deep freeze	Wattage. Look on the back of your freezer for the sticker or plate that shows the unit's annual wattage usage. To calculate how much it costs to run, take the annual wattage figure – using 1,235 kilowatt-hours for a pre-1980 chest unit – divide it by 12 to get the kilowatt-hours per month, or 103. An energy-efficient large freezer with more than 25 cubic feet will use about 956 kilowatt-hours per year, according to EnergyStar.gov. That equates to about $10 a month. When you reduce the size of your freezer, your costs go down. Standard freezer sizes run between 19 cubic feet and 22 cubic feet. Monthly costs for these units average about $67 per year or a little over $5 a monthA chest freezer sized below 16.5 cubic feet costs $53 per year, using a total of 404 kilowatt-hours per year, or 34 kilowatt-hours per month. When you divide $53 by 12, your monthly costs equate to a little more than $4 per month. An energy-efficient large freezer with more than 25 cubic feet will use about 956 kilowatt-hours per year, according to EnergyStar.gov. That equates to about $10 a month. When you reduce the size of your freezer, your costs go down. Standard freezer sizes run between 19 cubic feet and 22 cubic feet. Monthly costs for these units average about $67 per year or a little over $5 a

is verbena perennial	Verbena bonariensis is a tall and slender-stemmed perennial. It can grow to 6 ft (120 cm) tall and can spread to 3 ft (90 cm) wide. At maturity, it will develop a woody base. Fragrant lavender to rose-purple flowers are in tight clusters located on terminal and axillary stems, blooming from mid-summer until fall frost. Sometimes, the name Verbena brasiliensis, Brazilian verbena or Brazilian vervain, is found for this species. However, this is the result of a mix-up with V. brasiliensis, the true Brazilian verbena, which has been erroneously referred to as V. bonariaensis by several botanists.Printer Friendly Version (PDF). Verbenas are long blooming annual or perennial flowers that possess the virtues of heat tolerance and an extremely long bloom season. Many perennial verbenas are relatively short lived, but their vigor and heavy flowering make up for this defect. They do well grown as annual flowering plants also, since they bloom quickly during the first season after planting. ‘Homestead Purple’ Verbena (Glandularia canadensis), known for its long bloom season.

A COO may handle production schedules, marketing plans, quality control, personnel issues, and many other areas of operations
most common drugs among kids	Past-month use of marijuana remained steady among 8th graders at 6.5 percent, among 10th graders at 16.6 percent, and among 12th graders at 21.2 percent. Close to 6 percent of 12th graders report daily use of marijuana (similar to 2013), and 81 percent of them said the drug is easy to get. Among 8th graders, there was a drop in perceived availability in 2014, with 36.9 percent saying it is easy to get marijuana, compared to 39.1 percent in 2013. Other sources of information on drug use trends among youth are available: The annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, gathers detailed data on drug, alcohol, and tobacco use by all age groups.1 Ecstasy: This drug is very popular among the dance club scene and is now being marketed to kids, using cartoon character stamps. 2  With its designs and cheap prices, this stimulant has, unfortunately, become a popular pastime. 3  Inhalants: The presence of inhalants has become another danger in most teenage homes. Parents need to talk with their kids about drugs, and warn them about the severity of these substances. Perhaps with a little more time and effort spent on awareness, education and prevention, these trends won’t continue to surface among our teens.
where is the painted desert	Painted Desert. The Painted Desert encompasses over 93,500 acres and stretches over 160 miles. It begins about 30 miles north of Cameron, Arizona near the southeastern rim of the Grand Canyon to the Petrified Forest about 26 miles east of Holbrook, AZ. Along the way, it grazes the backyard of the Wupatki National Monument Indian Ruins. The most visited area of the Painted Desert is its eastern-end about 115 miles east of Flagstaff, Arizona. Both the Painted Desert and the Petrified Forest are about 26 miles east of Holbrook on Interstate 40 where you will find the Painted Desert Visitor's Center. The western-end of the Painted Desert can be accessed north on US 89 from Flagstaff AZ.

what other body systems are affected by parkinson disease	Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive disorder that affects nerve cells deep in the brain responsible for planning and controlling body movement. Dopamine is a chemical used in body movement. When the dopamine-producing nerve cells die, symptoms such as tremor, slowness, stiffness, and balance problems begin to occur. The cause of Parkinson's is largely unknown, and the disease cannot be cured at this time. To understand Parkinson's, it is helpful to understand how the nervous system works and how PD affects normal functions (see Anatomy of the Brain). Nerve cells, or neurons, are the basic building blocks of the nervous system. The neuron is responsible for sending and receiving nerve impulses or messages.In this section, there are nerve cells that produce a chemical called dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters pass from cell to cell, sending signals through the body. In people with Parkinson's disease, the nerve cells that produce dopamine don't work properly and less dopamine is produced. Other movement problems that develop are difficulty with walking and balance. Although considered a movement disorder, Parkinson’s disease also affects the body in other ways including loss of smell, vivid dreams, depression and other secondary symptoms.
how much does a adjunct professor get paid	Not surprisingly, at community colleges, adjuncts said they are paid much less. At Houston Community College, adjuncts reported earning between $1,200 and $2,200 for a three-credit English course. In some departments, adjuncts said anecdotally that pay depends on the degree held. One adjunct professor in history, for example, reported that where he or she works, instructors with Ph.D.'s earned about $800 more than those with master's degrees. Many adjuncts have also indicated that they are essentially shut out of participating in most forms of governance. The overall average pay reported by adjuncts is $2,987 per three-credit course. Adjuncts at 16 colleges reported earning less than $1,000. The highest pay reported is $12,575, in the anthropology department at Harvard UniversityThe salary range for adjuncts, however, can be considerably higher or lower, depending on the institution, the specialty and the terms of employment. Adjunct professors working as instructors average $45,977, while adjuncts with the title of lecturer earn $52,436. By comparison, adjuncts make almost half the salary of full-time tenured professors, whose salary averages $108,749. Earnings fluctuate by discipline, with education and humanities paying less than medicine, engineering, law and business.
when does a cut need stitches	Stitches are for larger cuts that a doctor believes will not heal correctly on their own. To heal correctly, the sides of a cut must be close together, so that the skin can grow back together. With large cuts, stitches help to bring the sides of a cut close together to heal properly. Whether or not you need stitches depends on how deep the cut is, and only your doctor can say for sure if your cut needs stitches. Your doctor can also tell you about any activities you shouldn't do when you have stitches. Thank you very much for checking out today's Wonder of the Day®! :-).It is important to determine if your wound needs to be closed by a doctor. Your risk of infection increases the longer the wound remains open. Most wounds that require closure should be stitched, stapled, or closed with skin adhesives (also called liquid stitches) within 6 to 8 hours after the injury. Some wounds that require treatment can be closed as long as 24 hours after the injury. Wash the wound well and stop the bleeding, then pinch the sides of the wound together. If the edges of the wound come together and it looks better, you may want to consider seeing your doctor for treatment. If treatment may be needed, do not use an antiseptic or antibiotic ointment until after a doctor has examined the wound
how can deforestation directly affect living organisms	The soil erosion caused by deforestation leads to a permanent improverishment of huge land areas. For insntace, simply replanting trees will not solve the problems caused by deforestation as the soil would be completely without essential nutrients by the time these trees have matured.Deforestation causes multiple social and environmental issues. Recently, there has been a growing recognition that immediate and short-term impacts of deforestation jeopardize our lives on Earth. Therefore, it is imperative for us to understand the effects of deforestation on our lives and environment, and utilize the knowledge in with finding effective solutions. First of all, deforestation contributes to an alternation of local and global climate through: Disruption of Natural Cycle. Carbon Cycle. Now we all know that carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the major contributors to the greenhouse effect (Global Warming). Deforestation, though not widely known, is directly connected to disruption of carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is the movement of carbon between the abiotic environment (the atmosphere and oceans) and living organisms (see figure 1.0)Forests serve as a major carbon store as CO2 is taken up from the atmosphere and used to produce fats, proteins and carbohydrates that constitute trees.
how fundus is measured	Fundal height. Fundal height is generally defined as the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus measured in centimeters. After the first 16 weeks of pregnancy, your fundal height measurement often matches the number of weeks you've been pregnant. For example, if you're 27 weeks pregnant, your health care provider would expect your fundal height to be about 27 centimeters. It isn't unusual, however, for your fundal height to measure somewhat smaller or larger than expected. This might happen if you: 1  Have a high body mass index.Fundal Height is a way to measure a pregnant belly to see if the gestational age is compatible with the uterus size. A baby growing inside of the womb of a pregnant woman will have a Fundal height measurement in centimeters that will match closely if not exactly with the amount of weeks the mother is pregnant. For example, a woman who is 33 weeks pregnant should have a Fundal height measurement of 32-34 centimeters. How do I measure my Fundal Height with the Mommy Measure? Place the beginning of the Mommy Measure on the top of the pubic bone and stretch out the tape to the top of the uterus. Next, mark your measurement on the centimeter marks on the scale to measure your Fundal Height. One centimeter represents one week of pregnancy.

which substances does the cell allow in	Through these channels, some substances such as hormones or ions are allowed to pass through. They either are recognized by a receptor (a protein molecule) within the cell membrane, or they attach to a carrier molecule, which is allowed through the channels. The plasma membrane surrounding animal cells is where the exchange of substances inside and outside of cells takes place. Some substances need to move from the extracellular fluid outside cells to the inside of the cell, and some substances need to move from the inside of the cell to the extracellular fluid. Some of the proteins that are stuck in the plasma membrane help to form openings (channels) in the membraneThe most important property of the cell membrane is its selective permeability: some substances can pass through it freely, but others cannot. Small and nonpolar (hydrophobic) molecules can freely pass through the membrane, but charged ions and large molecules such as proteins and sugars are barred passage. As with water, these substances “want” to enter the cell if the concentration gradient demands it. For that reason, cells have developed a way for such compounds to bypass the cell membrane and flow into the cell on the basis of concentration. The cell has protein channels through the phospholipid membrane.
how to walk with crutches	1 Place the crutches under your arms. 2  Squeeze them to the sides of your body. 3  Move the crutches 6 to 12 inches ahead. 4  They should be slightly away from your body. 5  Push down on the hand grips. 6  Step past the crutches. 7  Support your weight with your hands and not under your arms. 8  Check your balance before you go on. General directions for walking with crutches. 1  Place the crutches under your arms. 2  Squeeze them to the sides of your body. 3  Move the crutches 6 to 12 inches ahead. 4  They should be slightly away from your body. 5  Push down on the hand grips. 6  Step past the crutches. 7  Support your weight with your hands and not under your armsSwing your body slowly through the gap between the crutches, lifting your good leg and moving it forward. Place the foot of the good leg flat on the ground, keeping the other leg next to the good leg. Repeat the process until you get to your destination. 1  When pivoting, pivot with the strong leg, not the weak leg. 1 Your doctor may recommend at least a few sessions with a physical therapist to help you get the hang of crutches. 2  If you cannot put any weight on your leg, your doctor will likely send you to the physical therapist before you leave the hospital so that you can learn how to move around properly.
what is the adivasi	Adivasi of India Like all tribal people across the globe, the Adivasi of India were happy to live in lives that were uncomplicated by money. Till recently, they were living in harmony with their surroundings. The forest gave them food, clothing, material for housing and medicine. Like all tribal people across the globe, the Adivasi of. were happy to live in lives that were uncomplicated by money. Till recently, they were living in harmony with their surroundings. The forest gave them food, clothing, material for housing and medicine.Adivasi is an umbrella term for a heterogeneous set of ethnic and tribal groups considered the aboriginal population of South Asia. Adivasi make up 8.6% of India 's population or 104 million according to the 2011 census and 40% of Nepalese population. They comprise a substantial indigenous minority of the population of India and Nepal. The same term Adivasi is used for the ethnic minorities of Bangladesh, the native Madhesi people of Madhesh region of Nepal and also to the native Vedda people of Sri Lanka (Sinhalese: ආදී වාස). Land dispossession and subjugation by British and zamindar interests resulted in a number of adivasi revolts in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such as the Santal hul (or Santhal rebellion) of 1855–56.
how much is it for a vasectomy	A vasectomy is a simple sterilization procedure that can be performed right your doctor's office, so it tends to cost less than other surgeries. Over the long term, a vasectomy may even be less expensive than other birth-control options such as the Pill or IUDs. [ Click here to see our cost-comparison chart ]. Without insurance, the cost of a vasectomy typically ranges anywhere from $350 to $4,000, depending on location, surgical technique used, and other variables such as your method of payment and whether a doctor uses income-based sliding scales. 1 Co-payment-a flat fee paid at each doctor's visit (such as $25). 2  Deductible-a fixed amount that you have to pay before your health insurance policy covers the costs of a visit or procedure. 3  Coinsurance-the percentage of the doctor's costs that you are required to pay (such as 20 percent).Fancy American urologists charge up to $1,200 for the in-patient vasectomy procedure, which takes all of 10 minutes, including local anesthetic. Planned Parenthood charges about $100. Under Canada’s nationalized healthcare system, the procedure is free and the state pays the doctor $55. That may explain why one-third of Canadian men are sterilized. (The highest rate of vasectomy is in New Zealand, where half of men go under the knife). 
what causes intestinal fistula	A gastrointestinal fistula is an abnormal opening that allows the contents of the stomach or intestines to leak. 1  If it leaks through to a part of the intestines, it is called an entero-enteral fistula. 2  If it leaks to through to the skin, it is called an enterocutaneous fistula. Back to Top Causes. Most gastrointestinal fistulas occur after surgery. Other causes include: 1  Gastrointestinal obstruction. 2  Inflammatory processes, such as infection or inflammatory bowel disease (most often Crohn's disease). 3  Radiation to the abdomen (most often given as part of cancer treatment). 4  Trauma, especially penetrating wounds such as those due to a stabbing or gunshotDefinition.

why is pepsin initially synthesized as an inactive precursor	For instance, digestive enzymes which hydrolyze proteins are made as zymogens in the stomach and pancreas, in which pepsinogen is the inactive precursor (zymogen) and pepsin is the activated form of the enzyme. Another example is seen in blood clotting which is carried out by a cascade of proteolytic activations. Common uses in Biological Systems [edit]. Digestive enzymes are activated in the stomach and pancreas using this methodology. They are synthesized first as zymogens. Pepsinogen is the inactive protein which is initially transcribed. Then, it is cleaved in the stomach to produce Pepsin, a digestion enzyme. The purpose of this regulation is to prevent the Pepsin from digesting proteins in the body before it is introduced into the digestive tractThe mature, active enzymes are roughly 325 amino acids with a mass of approximately 35 kDa. Pepsins are synthesized as inactive pre-proenzymes, consisting of a signal peptide, activation peptide and active enzyme. The signal peptide is cleaved as the protein is inserted into endoplasmic reticulum and the resulting proenzyme-pepsinogen-is transported to the Golgi and condensed into secretory granules. Pepsinogens are secreted in a form such that the activation peptide assumes a compact structure that occludes the active site. 
what chemicals does tobacco contain	Tobacco smoke contains many chemicals that are harmful to both smokers and nonsmokers. Breathing even a little tobacco smoke can be harmful (1 - 4). Of the more than 7,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful, including hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia (1, 2, 5). Among the 250 known harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 69 can cause cancer. These cancer-causing chemicals include the following (1, 2, 5): 1  Acetaldehyde. Cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products vary widely in their content of nicotine, cancer-causing substances, and other toxicants. In a cigarette (which contains 0.49 to 0.89 gram of tobacco), the nicotine content can vary between 13.79 and 22.68 milligrams per gram of dry tobacco (12, 13).Chemicals in cigarettes and cigarette smoke are known to cause not only cancer but also other serious health problems. Many of the chemicals are poisonous. If a person ate one pack of cigarettes, he/she would die. Farmers use many chemicals to grow tobacco. They use fertilizers to make the soil rich and insecticides to kill the insects that eat the tobacco plant. After the tobacco plants are picked, they are dried, and machines break up the leaves into small pieces. Artificial flavorings and other chemicals are added.
do depressants improve sleep	First, as we know, sleep is not a passive process. It is an active one, and healthy brains sleep better than unhealthy ones. So it should not be a surprise that stimulants can often help people sleep better and depressants cause troubled sleep.There are also indirect effects. Stimulants can improve mood during the day and help the individual respond to stress. This could translate into better nights.heir sleep latency and efficiency improved, and in interviews the patients said they felt more rested. The group of patients who took the methylphenidate had substantially lower average time to fall asleep. They also spent less time in REM, which is a similar finding to when patients are given antidepressant drugs.However, many antidepressants can worsen sleep. Because of the activating effects of some drugs, for example imipramine, desipramine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, reboxetine and bupropion, many patients who take them have to be co-prescribed with sleep-promoting agents to improve sleep.lthough none of the reported changes in sleep are specific to depression, many of them, for example increased REM density and reduced amount of SWS in the first sleep cycle, are used as biological markers for research on depression and in the development of antidepressant drugs.

what causes pericardial effusion	Causes of Pericardial Effusion. Most pericardial effusions are caused by inflammation of the pericardium, a condition called pericarditis. As the pericardium becomes inflamed, extra fluid is produced, leading to a pericardial effusion. Viral infections are one of the main causes of pericarditis and pericardial effusions. Infections causing pericardial effusions include cytomegalovirus, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and HIV. Other conditions that can cause pericardial effusions include: 1  Cancer. 2  Injury to the pericardium or heart from a medical procedure. 3  Heart attack (myocardial infarction). 4  Uremia (severe kidney failure). 5  Autoimmune disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and others). 6  Bacterial infections, including tuberculosiTreatment of pericardial effusion is based on the underlying condition that is causing it and if the effusion is leading to severe symptoms, such as shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Depending on the cause, the excess fluid may be either rich in protein (exudate) or watery (transudate). 1 Antibiotics are used to treat pericardial effusions caused by an infection. 2  If a pericardial effusion is related to the presence of cancer, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or medication infused within the chest.
how Kilauea ash is formed	The eruptions which produced the Uwekahuna Ash were much larger than those of 1790, but most of the deposits are buried by younger lava flows of Kilauea and Mauna Loa. The Pahala Ash formed from even larger explosive eruptions earlier in Kilauea's history. Two one-to-two-meter thick ashes underlie the Uwekahuna Ash but overlie the thickest prehistoric ash, a reddish sequence of ash up to 85 feet thick where it is exposed in the Hilina Pali. The current eruption along Kilauea's East Rift Zone continues with passive effusion of lava. The lava is transported underground to the coast along the western edge of the flow field, where it enters the ocean after cascading over an ancient sea cliff.Structurally, Kīlauea has a large, fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones, one extending 125 km (78 mi) east and the other 35 km (22 mi) west, as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20 mm (0.1 to 0.8 in) per year. Activity in 1921–1923 followed. The next major eruption occurred in 1924. Halema ʻ uma ʻ u Crater, a fully formed pit crater after the 1919 event and the site of a sizable lava lake, first drained, then quickly began sinking into the ground, deepening to nearly 210 m (689 ft) beneath a thick cloud of volcanic ash.
signs and symptoms of hip replacement loosening	Loosening of the joint can occur at any time, but it normally occurs 10-15 years after the original surgery was performed. Signs that the joint has become loose include pain and feeling that the joint is unstable. Another operation (revision surgery) may be necessary, although this cannot be performed in all patients. Another common complication of hip replacement surgery is wear and tear of the artificial sockets. Particles that have worn off the artificial joint surfaces can be absorbed by surrounding tissue, causing loosening of the joint. If wear or loosening is noticed on X-ray, your surgeon may request regular X-rayAnswers. Best Answer: A frequent (but not the only) indication that revision hip replacement surgery is necessary is aseptic loosening of the prosthesis. (Aseptic means not related to infection, which is another reason for revision). The surest sign of a loose failed total hip is increasing and lasting pain and stiffness in the total hip accompanied by typical xray changes. The discomfort and pain usually develop slowly, years after an operation that was initially successful. The pain is usually in the whole hip area and in the thigh when both components of the total hip are loose. Patients with only the thigh component loose experience mainly thigh pain.
what causes migraine headaches everyday	A headache commonly occurs alone, but may occur with other symptoms. Associated symptoms can be important clues for identifying the underlying cause of a headache. Symptoms that may occur with headache include blurry vision, nausea, vomiting, fever, neck pain, neck stiffness, and increased sensitivity to light or noise. Headache. A person with a headache has discomfort beneath the scalp, forehead, or behind the eyes. Headaches may occur occasionally, or headaches may become chronic by occurring frequently.

what is a diol?	Another example is propane-1,2-diol, or alpha propylene glycol, HO−CH 2 −CH(OH)−CH 3, used in the food and medicine industry, as well as a relatively non-poisonous antifreeze product. On commercial scales, the main route to vicinal diols is the hydrolysis of epoxides. In general, organic geminal diols readily dehydrate to form a carbonyl group. For example, carbonic acid ((HO) 2 C=O) is unstable and has a tendency to convert to carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O). Nevertheless, in rare situations the chemical equilibrium is in favor of the geminal diol.A diol is a chemical compound containing two hydroxyl groups (−OH groups). This pairing of functional groups is pervasive, and many subcategories have been identified. The most common industrial diol is ethylene glycol. Examples of diols in which the hydroxyl functional groups are more widely separated include 1,4-butanediol HO−(CH 2) 4 −OH and bisphenol A, and propylene-1,3-diol, or beta propylene glycol, HO−CH 2 −CH 2 −CH 2 −OH. In general, organic geminal diols readily dehydrate to form a carbonyl group.

cerebral atrophy definition	Cerebral atrophy is a common feature of many of the diseases that affect the brain. Atrophy of any tissue means a decrement in the size of the cell, which can be due to progressive loss of cytoplasmic proteins. In brain tissue, atrophy describes a loss of neurons and the connections between them. Atrophy can be generalized, which means that all of the brain has shrunk; or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of the brain and resulting in a decrease of the functions that area of the brain controls. Many diseases that cause cerebral atrophy are associated with dementia, seizures, and a group of language disorders called the aphasias. Dementia is characterized by a progressive impairment of memory and intellectual function that is severe enough to interfere with social and work skills.Cerebral atrophy, then, signifies a decrease in the size of the brain that affects part or all of the brain. It causes a loss of brain mass and neurological disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, cerebral atrophy detected by a CT scan or an MRI is common. US FR ES. Atrophy defines a decrease in the size of an organ or tissue in relation to inadequate nutrition: this results in an imbalance between the formation of new cells which does not compensate for apoptosis or programmed cell death.
long term damage from oil spills	The oil spill in the Gulf Of Mexico, resulting from the explosion at a BP offshore drilling rig that tragically left 11 dead, is quickly growing to become the biggest ecological disaster this country has ever experienced. Here are 7 long-term consequences we must expect from this catastrophe. Close. In addition, as tragically seen from the Exxon Valdez disaster, local people can suffer long term personal damage from the devastation of their communities, with the escalated stress on families leading to increases in alcoholism, suicide, violence, and divorce.By Larry West. Oil spills often result in both immediate and long-term environmental damage. Some of the environmental damage caused by an oil spill can last for decades after the spill occurs. Here are some of the most notable environmental damages typically caused by oil spills: Oil Spills Damage Beaches, Marshlands and Fragile Marine Ecosystems. Oil spilled by damaged tankers, pipelines or offshore oil rigs coats everything it touches and becomes an unwelcome but long-term part of every ecosystem it enters. The long-term damage to various species, and to the habitat and nesting or breeding grounds those species depend upon for their survival, is one of the most far-reaching environmental effects caused by oil spills.

what are the major functions of muscle tissue	There are three different kinds of muscle tissue. One kind i … s attached to bones, and when these muscles shorten, they pull to make the body move in various ways. There are three types of muscle tissues: smooth, skeletal and cardiac. Smooth tissues regulate the blood pressure and flow of blood in arteries. The main function of muscle tissue is to contract to move things, but it is also used to contract and produce heat, and to contract and help the veins and lymph system return … blood back to the heart.I. FUNCTION AND TYPES OF MUSCLE. Locomotion: One of the most obvious functions of muscle tissue is locomotion. When muscles contract, the fibers pull or relax bones to which they are attached, thus causing locomotion. Muscle contraction is also the primary means of moving lymph in the lymphatic vessel. MUSCLES AND MUSCLE TISSUE. Muscle is composed of fibers, nerves and connective tissues and account for over 40% of the body weight. The fibers contract to produce tension on the associated tissues or tendons. Muscle tissue is enclosed in facia, which in turn is attached to other structures including ligament. There are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. Muscle tissue provides a) posture and body support b) locomotion and c) heat production
what are the capsid proteins in yellow fever	Functional requirements of the yellow fever virus capsid protein. Patkar CG, Jones CT, Chang YH, Warrier R, Kuhn RJ. Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, 915 W. State Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2054, USA. Erratum in J Virol. 2007 Dec;81(24):13944. Although it is known that the flavivirus capsid protein is essential for genome packaging and formation of infectious particles, the minimal requirements of the dimeric capsid protein for virus assembly/disassembly have not been characterized. Consistent with previous reports on the tick-borne encephalitis virus capsid protein, YFC demonstrates remarkable functional flexibility. Nearly 40 residues of YFC could be removed from the N terminus while the ability to package replicon RNA was retained.The flavivirus C protein belongs to the same class of alpha-helical capsid proteins as the hepadnaviruses and retroviruses (31, 38). Similar structural motifs have also been observed in the core proteins of arteriviruses and bacteriophage φ6 (9). Effect of capsid mutations on virus production. To study the effect of mutations in C protein on the viability of YFV, C-terminal truncations, internal deletions, and point mutations in the C-terminal helix were engineered into the full-length infectious cDNA clone of YFV.

what kind of dog was in the little rascals	But its most famous internee is Petey, the dog with the magic marker circle around one eye from the Our Gang (a.k.a. Little Rascals) movie short comedies. Of course, that was just the dog's stage name; his real name was Jiggs or General Grant -- or something. Three thousand miles away, much closer to Tinseltown, is the grave of a Petey at the famous Pet Memorial Cemetery in Calabasas, CA. Pet Memorial is also home to other pet celebrities and celebrity pets like Steven Spielberg's Jack Russell, Rudolph Valentino's dog, Kabar, and Hopalong Cassidy's horse, Topper.It was during this time that he acquired the circled eye, and when he was recruited to appear in the Our Gang comedies later that year, Hal Roach simply left it on, creating one of the most recognized dogs in film history. In the 1994 remake of The Little Rascals, the new Pete is an American Pitbull Terrier. Trainer and owner Lt. Harry Lucenay used one of Pal's offspring as Pete in the series after Pal was poisoned and died in 1930. The dog, named Lucenay's Peter, was bred by A. A. Keller. Roach used a number of unrelated dogs to portray Pete in Our Gang until 1938. Lucenay's Peter continued on and died of old age on January 28, 1946 in Los Angeles, California at age 17, two years after the Our Gang series ended.

SEER values typically range from 10 to 20, with higher ratings denoting more efficient power consumption.
what is dim	For men or women, DIM is something to consider as part of an overall supplement program. DIM, or diindolylmethane, is a plant based compound found in cruciferous vegetables, such as brussel sprouts,cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower. DIM has been shown in studies to reduce the risk of certain cancers, especially those driven by abnormally high estrogen levels, such as breast, uterus and prostate cancer. DIM (diindolylmethane), is a food-based compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and Brussel’s sprouts. Studies have shown that it has the ability to reduce the risk of certain cancers, especially those influenced by excessive estrogen levels, such as breast, uterine and prostateDIM. Cruciferous vegetables contain a natural compound called glucobrassicin. When you consume these foods, the acid in your stomach converts glucobrassicin to indole-3-carbinol, which then undergoes further chemical changes, eventually producing DIM, a stable and biologically active compound. Recommendations. DIM supplements are available as capsules from health-food stores and generally considered safe, although they may alter estrogen levels in women; do not take the supplements if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you have a hormone-sensitive disorder.

multiple or r squared definition	R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. The definition of R-squared is fairly straight-forward; it is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model. R-squared = Explained variation / Total variation. R-squared is always between 0 and 100%: 1  0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean. 2  100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.One class of such cases includes that of simple linear regression where r 2 is used instead of R 2. In this case, if an intercept is included, then r 2 is simply the square of the sample correlation coefficient (i.e., r) between the outcomes and their predicted values. If additional explanators are included, R 2 is the square of the coefficient of multiple correlation. In case of a single regressor, fitted by least squares, R 2 is the square of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient relating the regressor and the response variable. More generally, R 2 is the square of the correlation between the constructed predict
What wastes are created by metabolism protein	All the metabolic wastes are excreted in a form of water solutes through the excretory organs (nephridia, Malpighian tubules, kidneys), with the exception of CO 2, which is excreted together with the water vapor throughout the lungs. The elimination of these compounds enables the chemical homeostasis of the organism. (December 2009). Metabolic wastes or excretes are substances left over from excretory processes, which cannot be used by the organism (they are surplus or have lethal effect), and must therefore be excreted. This includes nitrogen compounds, water, CO2, phosphates, sulfates, etcAny amino acids that are left over after synthesis are either stored as fat or converted into energy. Amino acids can be classified as essential and non-essential. Essential amino acids cannot be made by the body but are essential to protein metabolism. These amino acids must be acquired from food. Non-essential amino acids are required for normal cell functioning and can be synthesized from other amino acids in the body. Athletes may supplement their diets with protein sources such as egg white powder, whey, casein or soy. Consuming too much protein places unnecessary strain on the body. Both meat and soy proteins contain all the essential amino acids that the body requires each day.
how long does it take for a lemon tree to grow	How Fast Lemon Trees Grow. A standard lemon tree will take 10 to 15 years to reach its full height of 20 to 30 feet. A semi-dwarf tree will grow from 15 to 20 feet tall and a dwarf tree, made possible by grafting lemon cultivars onto special rootstocks, will grow from 6 to 8 feet tall. Save. Lemon trees (Citrus limon) have a medium growth rate, adding 13 to 24 inches in height a year until they reach maturity. It takes most lemon trees about three years after planting to yield a small harvest of lemons suitable for picking, as long as they get the care they need.Mature Trees. Once your lemon tree begins fruiting, it consistently produces fruit every year under ideal climate and soil conditions. Each cultivar fruits during different seasons, but the majority are ready for harvesting between summer and winter. Producing fruit takes four to 12 months once the tree starts blossoming. During this flowering period, lemon trees rely on insects for cross-pollination and fruit development. Young Trees. Healthy lemon trees produce fruit in their third year. At this point, a well-established root system is in place and the tree has enough foliage to create the photosynthesis energy needed for fruit production. The key to fruit production starting in the third year is soil structure

what systems are affected by heart disease	When certain heart disease or circulatory system malfunction occurs, it can lead to the problems with the body’s metabolism. The most common heart disease is coronary artery disease (medically called arteriosclerosis) and it is a condition when the plaque forms in the walls of the arteries. Heart disease is the general term for all diseases and disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attack, stroke, coronary artery disease, and congenital or present at birth heart defects, as well as arrhythmia, angina and cardiomyopathy. Heart disease affects the body in several ways. As mentioned above, the circulatory system, which is also called cardiovascular system, has the role to supply the body cells and tissues with oxygen and nutrients, and therefore, the healthy circulatory system is vital for the survivalThe systemic circulation is the portion of the circulatory system is the network of veins, arteries and blood vessels that transports blood from heart, services the body's cells and then re-enters the heart, the Mayo Clinic noted. The pulmonary circulatory system sends oxygen-depleted blood away from the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns oxygenated blood to the heart through the pulmonary veins, according to the Mayo Clinic.

what is the function of a dendrite	Function of Dendrites. In order for neurons to become active, they must receive action potentials or other stimuli. Dendrites are the structures on the neuron that receive electrical messages. These messages come in two basic forms: excitatory and inhibitory. Excitatory action potentials increase the stimulation of a neuron, while inhibitory action potentials decrease the activity of the neuron. Instructor: John Williams. Dendrites are the segments of the neuron that receive stimulation in order for the cell to become active. They conduct electrical messages to the neuron cell body for the cell to function. This lesson discusses dendrites, their function, and their importance in neuron activityAn axon (from Greek ἄξων axōn, áxōn), axis is a, long slender projection of a nerve, cell or, neuron that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the'neuron s cell. Body myelinated axons are known as nerve. Fibers the function of the axon is to transmit information to different, neurons muscles and. glands Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.

Outside of its native range this snail thrives in many types of habitat in areas with mild climates. It feeds voraciously and is a vector for plant pathogens, causing severe damage to agricultural crops and native plants. It competes with native snail taxa, is a nuisance pest of urban areas, and spreads human disease. The giant African snail is a macrophytophagous herbivore; it eats a wide range of plant material, fruit, and vegetables. It will sometimes eat sand, very small stones, bones from carcasses and even concrete as calcium sources for its shell.
can i see my hemmorhoids	Hemorrhoids are engorged, often painful veins located in your anus. Hemorrhoids can build up in 2 different places. There are 2 distinct branches of veins that drain the blood from the lower rectum and anus.The internal veins can become swollen to form internal hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids, unless they are severe, cannot be seen or felt, unlike external hemorrhoids.Similarly, the external veins can enlarge to form external hemorrhoids. External hemorrhoids can be seen around the outside of the anus and, often, can be felt. Often a simple push of the hemorrhoids back into the rectum can solve the problem. 2  If the hemorrhoids cannot be reduced back into the rectum, then they will continue to inflame and can become trapped outside of the anus. 3  If your hemorrhoids become prolapsed and cannot be reduced, then you will need to see a doctor.Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. You usually can't see or feel these hemorrhoids, and they usually don't cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can damage a hemorrhoid's delicate surface and cause it to bleed.hen to see a doctor. Bleeding during bowel movements is the most common sign of hemorrhoids. But rectal bleeding can occur with other diseases, including colorectal cancer and anal cancer.
how much is light therapy for acne	1 When it comes to acne light therapy, more is not necessarily better. 2  Drying or burning the skin by holding the face too close to the lamp does not help. 3  The best way to use blue and red light therapy at home is for helping keep the skin clear between acne treatments. They are safe, but they are slow. And they don’t do all the work of acne skin care treatment. To make any acne light treatment system work, you also need a complete system of skin care, a collection of products such as you can find at Exposed Skin Care.Cost of Blue Light Acne Treatment. The cost of blue light acne therapy ranges from $40 for a single treatment to about $1,000 to $1,500 for a full treatment package, including several weekly sessions. The number of treatments needed to reach optimal results may vary depending on the severity of your acne. Patients who receive blue light photodynamic therapy will also have the topical solution Levulan® applied to their skin for 15 to 60 minutes before light exposure. When Levulan® is used prior to blue light acne treatment, patients spend only eight to ten minutes under the light, and the results are often enhanced. Blue light photodynamic therapy sessions are typically spaced two weeks apart to allow the full effects of the treatment session to appear

what what is geographical attrition like	Attrition is sorrow for one's sins that arrises from reasons other than love of God. If it is forced, someone is making you feel sorrow for your sins, but not for the actual a … ct of the sin, but because you are sorry that you were caught. It's difficult for a child, for example, to learn true attrition. For example, a child lies to his parent and is caught. The parent punishes the lie. The child cries, but not because he feels sorrow for the lie but because he does not like the punishment. In this context, Attrition is associated with the Catholic concept of imperfect contrition.   In the context of warfare, forced attrition refers to the slow depletion of one's fighting strength, usually due to outside forces beyond the control of the leader of the fighting force.On the other hand, Attrition wounds are caused by rubbing or friction like grinding of the teeth. 4. Abrasion occurs when one rock hit another surface. Attrition can be termed as a form of river or coastal erosion where the surface is washed away. There is also another meaning to attrition. Attrition also refers to a staff reduction in companies through usual process like resignation or retirement. Summary. 1. Abrasion is restricted to superficial destruction; attrition is not limited to such destruction. 2.
self employed deduction vs standard deduction	The standard deduction is a set amount based on your filing status – married filing jointly, single, head of household and so on. For the 2014 tax year, that's $6,200 for single or separate filers, $12,400 for married filers, and $9,100 for head of household filers. Other than above-the-line deductions covered above, the rest are tax breaks you can only take if you itemize. In effect, by itemizing you're foregoing the standard deduction (you can’t get both), and opting to take the specific deductions you list on your tax return. Some of the more common itemized deductions include: 1  Mortgage expense – This can include mortgage interest and mortgage insurance premiumSelf-employed business people can deduct expenses associated with their business to offset their self-employment income. You may even have a business loss that offsets other income, reducing your taxable income. These expenses are reported separately from your other tax deductions. Since business expenses are reported on Schedule C, you can deduct them even if you don’t itemize -- that is, if you choose to take the standard deduction. Additional Deductions. Even if you elect to take the standard deduction, the IRS does allow a few other deductions and credits that you can take on Form 1040 without itemizing.
what are the spongy muscles on each side of your knee cap	Torn ligament or tendon. Knee pain may be caused by torn ligaments or tendons. Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect the bones at the knee joint; tendons connect the muscles to the bone. You can tear these tissues during running sports such as rugby or football. Sudden pain in one of the knees is usually the result of overusing the knee or injuring it. In many cases, you don't need to see your GP. The knee joint is particularly vulnerable to damage and pain because it takes the full weight of your body and any extra force when you run or jump.Used to bend the knee. TENDONS OF THE KNEE: Tendons join muscle to bone. The quadriceps tendon hooks quad muscles to the patella (kneecap); patella tendon connects the patella to the shinbone. The quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon actually connect to form one continuous tendon that covers the patella. BONES OF THE KNEE: The femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), patella (knee cap), fibula (smaller bone next to shin bone). Muscles, tendons and ligaments connect the knee bones. The kneecap glides in a groove in the thighbone and adds leverage to the thigh muscles, which are used to extend the leg. The thigh bone and shine bone come together at the knee joint and move on one another when bending or straightening the leg
what is enlarged prostate	The prostate gland, which is normally about the size and shape of a walnut, wraps around the urethra between the pubic bone and the rectum, below the bladder. In the early stage of prostate enlargement, the bladder muscle becomes thicker and forces urine through the narrowed urethra by contracting more powerfully. As the prostate grows larger and the urethra is squeezed more tightly, the bladder might not be able to fully compensate for the problem and completely empty. In some cases, blockage from prostate enlargement may cause repeated urinary tract infections and gradually result in bladder or kidney damage.An enlarged prostate is the slow growth of the prostate gland, which is involved in the production of seminal fluid and reproductive function in men. The prostate wraps around the tube that transports urine out of the bladder. It is very common for the prostate gland to become enlarged as a man ages. An enlarged prostate is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is generally not caused by infection or cancer. An enlarged prostate many not cause any symptoms or noticeable problems in some men. However, as men age, an enlarged prostate may grow to the point where it presses on the bladder and urethra, causing urine flow to be slower and less forceful.
what is irons structure	The face-centered cubic structure, which is called austenite, is stable in a temperature range everywhere between the above-mentioned two temperature ranges, and the iron of this structure in this temperature range is called iron. Particularly important lattice defects are (i) vacancies, which are point-like defects in which an iron atom is missing at a lattice point, and (ii) dislocations, which are linear defects. Vacancies play an important role in the diffusion of atoms, and plastic deformation occurs when dislocations move.The structure of iron is an example of a giant molecule. FALSE. In iron the positive ions are packed together in a giant lattice but we use the word molecule to imply that the structure contains covalent bonds which iron does not. In the structure of iron there are positive ions. TRUE. For a series of statements about the bonding in iron, students decide whether they are true or false. This leads to further thinking and discussion about the bonding in metals. This activity checks on the misconceptions that: 1  the structure of iron is an example of a giant molecule. 2  the atoms of iron are held together by ionic bonds. 3  iron conducts electricity because iron atoms move through the solid. 4  iron expands when heated because the atoms get bigger

garage cost per square foot	It doesn't include labor, supplies such as reinforcing bar, if needed, or building permit fees. At the time of publication, the average cost of concrete for a 400-square foot slab, the typical size for a two-car garage, ranges between $583 and $637 or between $1.46 and $1.59 per square foot. On average, contractors will put in about 13 hours of labor to finish a two-car concrete garage slab. The total cost for a concrete garage floor, including concrete, labor, supplies and equipment, varies region to region because of geographic variables. The total cost for a 400-square-foot garage floor in San Francisco ranges between $3.91 and $4.28 per square foot and between $3.26 and $3.60 per square foot in Atlanta.by Jay Behm-A very basic way to estimate the cost of building a detached garage is to simply apply a typical average per square foot construction of $30 to $40. That is for an average cost basis for having a contractor / builder build a basic one story garage for you on your property. If you are in an area with higher-than-average cost of living you can use $50 to $55. If there are complications or you prefer top quality materials and components the price can go up.So, generally speaking, a 24 ft.sq., two car, basic garage will cost in the range of $17,000 to $23,000.
which part of the spine curves inward from a posterior view	Kyphosis is defined by an excessive outward curve of the spine and may cause a deformity such as a humpback or hunchback. Abnormal kyphosis is more commonly found in the thoracic or thoracolumbar (chest area/low back), but can affect the neck too. Curves are a normal part of the spine's structure. Looking at the spine from the side (lateral), several curves can be seen (Figure 1-A). From this angle, the spine almost resembles a soft 'S' shape.Lordosis. 1  Cervical Lordosis-inward curve in the upper (cervical) region of the spine, i.e. the neck area. 2  Thoracic Lordosis-inward curve in the upper (thoracic) region of the spine. 3  Lumbar Lordosis-inward curve in the lower (lumbar) region of the spine. When viewed from either the posterior or anterior direction i.e. from directly behind or directly in front of the person, normal spines appear to be straight. See, for e.g. an anterior view of a human skeleton. 1. Kyphosis Excessive outward (backwards) curvature of the spine, causing hunching of the back. 2. Lordosis Inward (forwards) curvature of the spine. Some lordosis in the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine is normal. Exaggerated lordosis may occur in adolescence-possibly as a result of faulty posture, or due to disease affecting the vertebrae and spinal muscles
what is pearson's syndrome symptoms	Pearson Syndrome is classified as a mitochondrial disease because it consists of several overlapping syndromes that are caused by mutations of mitochondrial DNA. Specifically, Pearson Syndrome is a combination of syndromes that involves the bone marrow and the exocrine pancreas. It is usually fatal in infancy. The few patients who survive into adulthood often develop symptoms of Kearns-Sayre syndrome. It is caused by a deletion in mitochondrial DNA. Pearson syndrome is very rare, less than hundred cases have been reported in medical literature worldwide.Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is a severe disorder that usually begins in infancy. It causes problems with the development of blood-forming (hematopoietic) cells in the bone marrow that have the potential to develop into different types of blood cells. For this reason, Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is considered a bone marrow failure disorder. Function of the pancreas and other organs can also be affected. Most affected individuals have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), which can cause pale skin (pallor), weakness, and fatigue. In people with Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome, the pancreas does not work as well as usual. The pancreas produces and releases enzymes that aid in the digestion of fats and proteins.
how long does a bad report stay on your credit	Most information (good and bad) will stay on your credit report for seven years. However, some financial disasters (divorce, bankruptcy) can stay for as long as ten years. The … silver lining to this is that, the older the negative information is, the less influence it has on the overall report. 1 The seven year statute of limitations on information listed on your credit report figures from the date of last activity. 2  According to the FCR Act Section 605 a debt can remain on a credit report for 7 years and 180 days after the delinquency that caused the account to go bad.- Good credit stays for 10 years and then it is aged off but can stay longer. - Bankruptcies that, from the date of adjudication, (means decision) antedate (means predate) the report by more than 10 years. - Collection accounts and charge offs remain for 7 years from first serious delinquency or charge off date. (NOT the last date of activity.) - Paying an old debt does NOT reset the clock on reporting for another 7 years. (Paid tax liens are reported for 7 years from date paid not filed! So pay them quickly!) - Records of arrest, indictment, information, misdemeanor complaint, or conviction of a crime that, from the date of disposition, release, or parole, antedate the report by more than seven years.

density of ice as a function of temperature	An unusual property of ice frozen at atmospheric pressure is that the solid is approximately 8.3% less dense than liquid water. The density of ice is 0.9167 g/cm 3 at 0 °C, whereas water has a density of 0.9998 g/cm³ at the same temperature. Liquid water is densest, essentially 1.00 g/cm³, at 4 °C and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form the hexagonal crystals of ice as the freezing point is reached. When ice melts, it absorbs as much energy as it would take to heat an equivalent mass of water by 80 °C. During the melting process, the temperature remains constant at 0 °C.

what is tuckpointing	1 Tuckpointing helps to prevent water from entering into the chimney system. 2  If the mortar joints are not repaired, water will seep down the chimney and sometimes between the chimney and the flue lining. 3  Moisture can do a serious amount of unseen damage, such as cause mold, mildew, and rotting wood. Tuckpointing is really a crucial procedure, to preserve the life of a chimney. Some of the benefits of performing needed tuckpointing on chimneys follow: 1  Corrosion of the mortar joints is stopped. 2  Structural stability of the chimney is restored. 3  Failing to repair mortar joints will result in a weak chimney structure which will eventually begin to lean or collapseBrickwork of 10 Downing Street, showing fine white fillets in carefully matched dark mortar. Tuckpointing is a way of using two contrasting colours of mortar in the mortar joints of brickwork, one colour matching the bricks themselves, to give an artificial impression that very fine joints have been made. Standard tuckpointing tools come in widths from as little as 1 mm to up to 14 mm wide, so these tools can be used for very fine detailed work up to wide stone tuckpointing work. Lengths of tools also vary depending on personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 75 and 125 mm.
what type of muscle fibers make up skeletal muscle	Skeletal muscle is a form of striated muscle tissue which is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. It is one of three major muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. Most skeletal muscles are attached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers known as tendons. Skeletal muscle is made up of individual muscle cells or myocytes, known as muscle fibers. They are formed from the fusion of developmental myoblasts (a type of embryonic progenitor cell that gives rise to a muscle cell) in a process known as myogenesis. Muscle fibres are cylindrical, and multinucleated. Each skeletal muscle fiber is a single cylindrical muscle cell. An individual skeletal muscle may be made up of hundreds, or even thousands, of muscle fibers bundled together and wrapped in a connective tissue covering. Each muscle is surrounded by a connective tissue sheath called the epimysium. Fascia, connective tissue outside the epimysium, surrounds and separates the muscles. Structure of Skeletal Muscle. A whole skeletal muscle is considered an organ of the muscular system. Each organ or muscle consists of skeletal muscle tissue, connective tissue, nerve tissue, and blood or vascular tissue. Skeletal muscles vary considerably in size, shape, and arrangement of fibers.
what is the kyoto protocol designed to do	The Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system (Art. 2). Collectively the group of industrialized countries committed to a Kyoto target, i.e., the Annex I countries excluding the USA, have a target of reducing their GHG emissions by 4.2% on average for the period 2008-2012 relative to the base year, which in most cases is 1990.The Kyoto Protocol is a plan created by the United Nations for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that tries to reduce the effects of climate change, such as global warming. The plan says that countries that adopt (follow) the Kyoto Protocol have to try to reduce how much carbon dioxide (and other  greenhouse gases  that pollute the atmosphere) they release into the air. The full name of the Kyoto Protocol is the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is called the Kyoto Protocol because it was made in Kyoto, Japan. The Kyoto Protocol was officially put into full force on February 16, 2005. On February 16, Russia began to follow (ratify) the Kyoto Protocol and it was decided to be put into full force

what degree is needed to become a psychologist	A master's degree is the minimum requirement for most psychologist positions, and jobs in some branches of psychology will require you to have a doctorate degree. Upon completion of a doctorate program in psychology, you will be awarded either a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) or Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, www.bls.gov) reported in 2012 that some states will allow you to work as a school psychologist with a master's degree in psychology, but many states now require you to have an education specialist degree such as an Ed.S. in school psychology or a doctoral degree (www.bls.gov).The Path to Becoming a Psychologist. First, you will need a bachelor's degree (4 to 5 years), which teaches the fundamentals of psychology. After that, you will need a master's degree (2 to 3 years), which can qualify you to practice in the field as a case manager, employment specialist, or social worker. Master's Degree (2 to 3 Years). A master's degree will give you a broad introduction to the field of psychology. You can then use your electives to focus your study in a particular field. Successful graduates of this program often pursue positions in education, government, human services, health care mental health care, and marketing/advertising
what is the continental shelf	The continental shelf is an underwater landmass which extends from a continent, resulting in an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea. Much of the shelves were exposed during glacial periods and interglacial periods. The shelf surrounding an island is known as an insular shelf. The continental margin, between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain, comprises a steep continental slope followed by the flatter continental rise. Sediment from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment at the base of the slope, called the continental rise. The shelf area is commonly subdivided into the inner continental shelf, mid continental shelf, and outer continental shelf, each with their specific geomorphology and marine biology. The character of the shelf changes dramatically at the shelf break, where the continental slope begins.The continental shelf edge is an area that is located at the edge  of an underwater landmass. This landmass extends out from a  continent and has a relatively shallow area o … f water which is often  referred to as the shelf sea. A continental shelf is the flat or gently sloping land that lies submerged around the edges of a continent and that extends from the shoreline out to the continental slope.
what does a blood test checking colon mean	Polyps or tumours in the colon have blood vessels that can release a small amount of blood onto the stool when it passes by. Stool tests check for this occult (hidden) blood that you can’t see with your eyes. Two types of stool tests are used in Canada to screen for colorectal cancer. Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT). Uses a chemical reaction on a paper card to find traces of blood in the stool. Other reasons for having blood in the stool. Having blood in your stool doesn’t always mean that you have polyps or cancer. Blood may come from the colon or from other parts of the digestive tract, such as the stomach or anus. The bleeding can be caused by: 1  ulcers (sores on the lining of your digestive tract).1 And a negative FOBT (no blood found) does not mean that you do not have polyps or colorectal cancer. 2  If a fecal occult blood test is positive for blood in the stool, it is important to have a colonoscopy to help your doctor find the source of the blood and remove polyps if they are found. 1 If the test is positive for blood in the stool, you may need to have a colonoscopy. 2  Stool DNA test (sDNA). 3  This test checks for changes to the cells in the colon by looking at DNA in the stool. 4  Certain kinds of changes in cell DNA happen when you have cancer
what is the difference between refraction and diffraction	1.7k Views. DIFFRACTION: The phenomenon of bending of light around the corners of an obstacle or aperture into region of geometrical shadow. The diffraction of light more pronounced when the dimension of the obstacle or aperture is comparable to the wavelength of the wave. Reflection: When light beam is in contact with a reflective polished surface than it traces its path according to laws of reflection. Diffraction: Its a phenomenon by which light bends around the corner of small obstacles and it spreads out. (You can imagine this obstacle as a very sharp corner of a lab plane mirror).Difference Between Diffraction and Refraction. • Diffraction is bending or spreading of waves around an obstacle, while refraction is bending of waves due to change of speed. • Both diffraction and refraction are wavelength dependant. Hence, both can split white light in to its component wavelengths. Intensity of the fringes decreases as we move along either side of the central maxima. Refraction. When a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle except 90° and 0°, its line of travel changes at the interface due to the change in velocity of the wave. This is what we call refraction. Although light waves provide most of the examples for refraction, any other wave can also refract
what are the rarest minerals on earth	However, because of their geochemical properties, rare earth elements are typically dispersed and not often found concentrated as rare earth minerals in economically exploitable ore deposits. It was the very scarcity of these minerals (previously called earths) that led to the term rare earth. The first such mineral discovered was gadolinite, a mineral composed of cerium, yttrium, iron, silicon and other elements. Rare earth elements became known to the world with the discovery of the black mineral Ytterbite (renamed to Gadolinite in 1800) by Lieutenant Carl Axel Arrhenius in 1787, at a quarry in the village of Ytterby, Sweden.What is the second rarest element on Earth? The second rarest element on Earth is unstable so it does not have a long life (22min.), but uranium is the rarest natural element and is the second heavist natural element. … Actually, there are even rarer elements that last for less then fractions of a second. Some are so rare that they haven't even been discovered. 6 people found this useful. The second rarest element on Earth is unstable so it does not have a long life (22min.), but uranium is the rarest natural element and is the second heavist natural element. … Actually, there are even rarer elements that last for less then fractions of a second.
effects of glial cells on learning and memory	Kaufer’s lab focused on neural stem cells in the hippocampus of the brains of adult rats under acute or chronic stress. These stem cells were previously thought to mature only into neurons or a type of glial cell called an astrocyte. However, the researchers found that chronic stress made stem cells in the hippocampus mature into another type of glial cell called an oligodendrocyte, which produces the myelin that sheaths nerve cells. Chronic stress decreases the number of stem cells that mature into neurons and might provide an explanation for how chronic stress also affects learning and memory, according to the researchers. “Usually the brain doesn’t make much oligodendrocytes in adulthood from those neural stem cells,” according to Kaufer.One of the many important roles cholesterol plays in the body is in our nervous system, enabling learning and memory to take place. In fact, one of the reasons that sleep is beneficial to our learning and memory is because it enables our brain to make more cholesterol! In the absence of this-- as yet unknown-- glial factor, neurons formed few synapses, and the synapses they formed were inefficient and poorly functioning. In the presence of glial cells, which secrete the unknown factor, neurons formed many, highly efficient synapses.
how much sleep does a newborn need	Your baby needs lots of sleep. The average newborn sleeps for up to 16 hours a day, although it may not feel like this much to you! At first your baby will need to wake up frequently for feeds, probably every three hours to four hours in the day, with longer spells at night. Find out more about how much sleep your baby needs. If possible, your baby should sleep in the same room as you (Lullaby Trust 2013) for the first six months. In fact, the amount of noise your newborn makes while he sleeps may surprise you! Your baby's sleep can be deep and still, and active and noisy all in one night. He may even make little jerking movements. This is known as the startle reflex (moro reflex) and it usually settles down at around two months to three months.Your baby needs lots of sleep, but she won't stay asleep for more than three hours or four hours at a time in her first few months. She needs to wake frequently so that she can refill her tummy, so be prepared for some interrupted nights. But be reassured that once your baby is about three months old, you can start to follow a set pattern every night. By six months she may even sleep through the night, allowing you to get more sleep again. Your baby will quickly come to appreciate the consistency and predictability of a routine.
what is the meaning of pvc	Polyvinyl chloride, more correctly but unusually poly(vinyl chloride), commonly abbreviated PVC, is the third-most widely produced synthetic plastic polymer, after polyethylene and polypropylene. PVC comes in two basic forms: rigid (sometimes abbreviated as RPVC) and flexible. The rigid form of PVC is used in construction for pipe and in profile applications such as doors and windows. It is also used for bottles, other non-food packaging, and cards (such as bank or membership cards). Polyvinyl chloride is produced by polymerization of the vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), as shown. About 80% of production involves suspension polymerization. Emulsion polymerization accounts for about 12% and bulk polymerization accounts for 8%.Noun. 1.

morel mushrooms when do they grow	When trying to see if a morel will continue to grow, there are a couple of factors that must be used in order for it to work. The color will indicate when the shroom is done growing. If it is still grey, it is NOT done. Once it is yellow, its done! Also, leaving a grey sit to see if it will grow, allows it to dry out. Mike had taken a series of images of a small grey morel over a 6 day period and once again is proof that depending on when you first spot the morel, they do in fact grow. The Great Morel is pleased to present this 2009 study from Clint Ely, in West Virgina.Morel Growth. Morels normally grow in a five-year cycle of gathering and storing nutrients after the spores fall, cross-pollinate and germinate. The root system that supports the sprouting morel is annual and is replaced each season after it deteriorates. Morels emerge in moist, warm soil -- a good time to search for them is after the first rain of the season and during the first warm days of spring, when the night temperature stays above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Though efforts to cultivate them haven't been successful, they're easy to identify and collect where they grow in the wild. Collect morels in mesh bags to let the microscopic spores fall and possibly begin another growth cycle near the same site.

where do honey badgers live	The honey badger-also known as ratal-is part of the Mustelidae family. Honey badgers are not anything to do with badgers, they are only called honey badgers because in french … , badger means the word dig, honey badgers are very extreme when it comes to claws and teeth. Claws are used for digging and also breaking into a bee hives, that's where the name HONEY comes from. Honey is the honey badger's favorite treat, although they do not rely on honey, but the nutritious bee hive is a sought after delicacy. The honey guide bird, has a habit of le … ading honey badgers to the bees' nests, and eats the honey, larvae, and wax from bee hives.The honey badger's odor doesn’t last long, like that of a skunk’s, but it still gets its message across: “Leave me alone!”. Honey badgers are native to areas of Africa and Asia, from southern Morocco to Africa’s southern tip, and western Asia’s Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, and western India. They live mainly in dry areas but are also found in forests and grasslands. Honey badgers are good swimmers and can climb trees. With those long claws, the honey badger digs burrows up to 9 feet (3 meters) long and up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep. A single tunnel ends in a chamber, which is usually bare, where the honey badger rests.

what temp to cook beef ribs	You can do a low temperature cook on your ribs the same way you would do your pork shoulders. It's just the cooking times are shorter, that's all. Set your oven to 250-275F, and roast those ribs until they're done. I've had beef ribs done in as few as 3-4 hours, but as many as 5. Optionally, you can foil your ribs about halfway into your cook, with some liquid in the foil pack. Just be aware that they'll cook faster if they're foiled. All, I would like to cook spare ribs to a fall-off-the-bone consistency. I don't have access to a grill. I know how to do that with pork shoulders (dry rubbed, then uncovered in the oven at low heat for 6-8hrs), but spare ribs are a different type of animal.2. About 30 minutes before cooking beef ribs remove from the refrigerator, unwrap to bring it to room temperature. Soak 1-2 three inch wood chunks covered in cold water for 1 hour and drain or soak 2 cups wood chips 15 minutes and drain, place chips in an aluminum or tinfoil container. Cooking beef ribs can be done with dry heat, moist heat, smoked or any combination. Cooking with moist heat the meat tends to fall off the bones a little easier however to acquire a great taste, some of the best bbq ribs recipes use a dry and smokey heat that really bring out that great prime rib flavor.
what color is liquid kenalog injection	Dogs and Cats: The recommended dosage is 0.05 mg to 0.1 mg triamcinolone acetonide per pound body weight as a single injection for the treatment of inflammatory or allergic disorders. For the treatment of dermatologic disorders, administer a single injection of 0.l mg per pound body weight. Dogs in Group II received the same dosage of Med-Tech's Triamcinolone Acetonide Injection. The dosage for all treatments was administered at the rate of 0.1 mg triamcinolone acetonide per pound of body weight to the nearest 0.01 ml.Kenalog Scar Injections. Not everyone is looking for acne scar removal treatments, many also seek keloid scar removal. Keloids are a type of scar that tends to keep growing. It is usually in the form of a raised area of skin with a smooth top and a pink or purple color. Normally, they do not go away without treatment. Kenalog (steroid) is injected into acne or pimples and this helps in repressing the activity in the body which causes infection, redness, and swelling. This procedure helps to solve the problem instantly. Kenalog injection for acne treats acne well, but there are some minor side effects. These include stretch marks, redness, itching, skin peeling, and skin thinning. Excessive use can lead to blurred vision, weight gain, fatigue, and insomnia
how to cook eggs without sticking	Coat the bottom of a frying pan or skillet with nonstick cooking spray. If you do not have nonstick cooking spray, you may substitute butter. Cut a chunk of butter and hold it in your hand as you rub it into the bottom of the pan. Leave the remainder of the butter in the pan. Place the pan over medium heat. You may need to tilt the pan to cover the whole surface with butter. Prepare the eggs. If you are scrambling the eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, beat them with a fork or a whisk and add seasonings, like salt and pepper. For extra flavor, you may wish to add garlic powder and paprika to them as well.If you are using butter, you want the butter to melt and coat the pan evenly. You may need to tilt the pan to cover the whole surface with butter. Prepare the eggs. If you are scrambling the eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, beat them with a fork or a whisk and add seasonings, like salt and pepper. For extra flavor, you may wish to add garlic powder and paprika to them as well. If you are going to fry the eggs, crack them into a bowl, but do not beat them. Pour the eggs into the heated pan. For scrambled eggs, begin scrambling them from the start. Use the spatula to move the egg mixture around in the pan. This constant movement will help the eggs not stick to the bottom

electrical upgrade cost	For example, if you are upgrading an old fuse box to a circuit breaker, that's a good time to upgrade the service to your house to a 200 amp service, simply because the service will often have to be disconnected and reconnected anyway. This project can cost between $700 and $1,500. Cost of Redoing the Electrical in a House. In older homes, even changing an outlet can quickly require a major electrical overhaul. Updating the electrical wiring in a house is not the way most homeowners want to spend their remodeling budget. Rewiring an entire house can range anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. The cost depends heavily on the age and construction of the house, instead of the size of the home1 Typically it costs $800-$1,200 to have a qualified electrician upgrade an existing panel to 100 amps, or $1,500-$2,500 if a new panel is needed. 2  Expect to pay $1,300-$3,000 to upgrade to 200 amps, or $2,000-$4,000 to go to 400 amps. 3  Installing a new sub-panel runs $500-$1,000.

cultural boundary definition	Moving away from physical boundaries, we now come to cultural boundaries. Also called an ethnographic boundary, a cultural boundary is a boundary line that runs along differences in ethnicity, such as language and religion.When speaking of cultural boundaries based on language, a great example of this is found within the country of Canada, where French is the official language of Quebec.It is also spoken in pockets or other provinces, whereas much of the rest of the country speaks English.hen speaking of cultural boundaries based on language, a great example of this is found within the country of Canada, where French is the official language of Quebec. It is also spoken in pockets or other provinces, whereas much of the rest of the country speaks English.It is an area that is relatively homogeneous with regard to one or more cultural traits. The geographer who identifies a formal culture region must locate cultural borders. Because cultures overlap and mix, such boundaries are rarely sharp, even if only a single cultural trait is mapped.ifferent boundaries may also be drawn depending on the particular aspect of interest, such as religion and folklore vs. dress and architecture vs. language. Cultural areas are not considered equivalent to Kulturkreis (Culture circles).
what food is a good source of iron	Dried beans and dark green leafy vegetables are especially good sources of iron, even better on a per calorie basis than meat. Iron absorption is increased markedly by eating foods containing vitamin C along with foods containing iron. Vegetarians do not have a higher incidence of iron deficiency than do meat eaters. Fortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed. Commonly eaten combinations, such as beans and tomato sauce or stir-fried tofu and broccoli, also result in generous levels of iron absorption.The type of dietary iron you consume greatly determines how much of the iron you eat is absorbed by the body. Heme iron one type of dietary iron. It is more readily absorbed by the body because it is derived from foods that once contained hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells. Nonheme iron is the other form of dietary iron. Chicken livers on a plate with garnishes Photo Credit intek1/iStock/Getty Images. Foods that once contained hemoglobin are the only sources of the heme type of dietary iron. Animal products originally containing hemoglobin such as red meat, poultry and seafood are all good sources of heme iron.
who makes sunlight dishwashing liquid	Dishwashing liquid, the kind you squirt into your sink to do dishes by hand, is something that most of us have in our kitchens. After over 60 hours of research we think Seventh Generation Dish Liquid is the one you want.

what county is wylie texas in	The construction of Lake Lavon five miles north of town and the selection of Wylie to house the offices of the North Texas Municipal Water District, designed to provide water for towns in four counties, pushed the population to 1,804 in 1960. Before 1920 the community had over thirty-five businesses, including two banks, a school, and a weekly newspaper. Unlike many rural Texas communities, Wylie grew during the Great Depression years, reaching 914 residents by 1940. In part this was a result of increased dairy farming to meet the demands of nearby Dallas. Following World War II the population continued to increaseNot to be confused with the unincorporated area of Wylie, Taylor County, Texas, just outside Abilene. Wylie is a city once solely located in Collin County but now extends into neighboring Dallas, and Rockwall counties in the U.S. state of Texas.

process of forming fraternal twins	Meaning, having twins in your family will make no difference in the possibility of conceiving identical twins. Identical twins seem to occur randomly throughout the population without rhyme or reason. Fraternal twins (dizygotic) occur when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm. Two separate babies with no more in common than siblings born at different times are formed. Fraternal twins can be the same sex and/or blood type. Two separate babies with identical DNA are formed. Identical twins are always the same sex and blood type. They almost always share the same placenta but may also have two separate placentas. Depending on when the egg splits usually determines if identical twins will share the same placenta, and/or chorions and amnions.Fraternal (Non-identical) twins are formed when two egg cells are fertilized; each egg by a different sperm so that two embryos are formed.

virus reproduce name	A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.he viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.Viruses function by reproducing. However, in the real sense they do not really reproduce, but multiply. The virus structure is made in a way that allows it to replicate itself, thus creating numerous viruses. This is the reason why many will refer to the process as reproduction.There are two main ways that viruses reproduce or multiply and these are listed below. 1  Lytic Cycle: With the lytic cycle, the virus attaches itself to a host cell and infuses the cell with its nucleic acid.his is the reason why many will refer to the process as reproduction.
